Kamilla Cardoso, who's <a href=# rel=noopener>no longer</a> on a minutes restriction, had 10 points, nine rebounds and three blocks.

Her first 20 &amp;amp; 10 game tonight. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WNBA?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WNBA&lt;/a></p>Tameka Mullins, PMP¬Æ <span class=acct>@tamstarz</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've been saying that Angel Reese can be a 20/10 chick! Lots of good things in this game. The Sky just need to cut down on the turnovers &amp;amp; get more pure scoring! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WNBA?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WNBA&lt;/a></p><p>This was always going to be a rebuilding year for the Sky, one which their best hope was that they'd identify the pieces that will form the foundation for their next phase of playoff contention. The early returns on Reese and Cardoso are exactly what you'd want in that respect.</p><p>Chicago has a great opportunity to add two wins before the week is out. The Sky hit the road to play the 1-12 Washington Mystics on Friday and then head to Indianapolis for a date with the 3-10 Indiana Fever on Sunday.</p><p>The latter will pit Reese and Carter against Caitlin Clark for their first meeting since Carter's flagrant foul on the No. 1 overall pick sparked days of discourse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmDcn2MmqWgnZxiv6ax0p5koJ2kqHqtu9WeZJ%2Bqn6J6uLrBmmSfmZ6oeqWx0qmgrZ1dqLi6v4ylpqyrXam8bq3LsqqsmV2ptbC5wKxkrK2e</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./102-funny-halloween-jokes-for-kids-and-adults-with-answers.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>102 Funny Halloween Jokes For Kids and Adults (With Answers)</span></a>
