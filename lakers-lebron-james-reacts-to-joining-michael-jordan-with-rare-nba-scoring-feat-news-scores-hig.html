"But being able to have a growth mindset and be able to work on things that the league is changing to, the league is a heavy three-point shooting league.</p><p>"I'm not one of those guys that wants to go out there and shoot 12, 14 or 15 threes per game. But I want to be respected, and teams have to play me from the outside. That's still kind of one thing teams [think] ... 'If we have to give up something, we'd much rather him shoot the ball from the outside.'"</p><p>James' 41.6 percent clip from beyond the arc is on pace to be a personal best. In general, he has made the three-pointer a larger part of his game since signing with the Lakers. His 6.4 attempts and 32.3 percent attempt rate are his most with any one team, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Basketball Reference</a>.</p><p>Also after Sunday's game, the 39-year-old there's "not very long" left in his NBA career, which isn't all that revelatory given how he has flirted with retirement <a href=# rel=noopener>more openly</a> in recent seasons. Leaning even more heavily into a perimeter game would undoubtedly help extend his time in the Association depending on how much longer he wants to go.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWp%2Bdn%2BMpZiknaKoeq2xwaump2Walrqmv4yrnJqbpKh6tbuMo6aippmjtG65yJyfmp2cYrewvsOapWavmam1br7Aq5xmppKWerSvzqugp59dm7KiwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kyle-thousand-wiki-age-height-net-worth-wife-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</span></a>
