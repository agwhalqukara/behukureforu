What happened to him? Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>John Robert Hill Jr. was born in Jacksonville, Florida USA, on 3 August 1996, so under the zodiac sign of Leo and holding American nationality – known by his stage name of Boonk, he is popular for his career of a rapper, while he is also an Instagram star.</p><p>While some people believe something has happened to Boonk because he hasn’t released a song in a while, he is doing well and is working on his new songs.</p><h2><span id=Childhood_and_education>Childhood and education</span></h2><p>Boonk grew up in a huge family as he has 14 siblings – eight from his father’s side and six from his mother’s side. His parents divorced when he was still very young and both of them remarried in the next two years – Boonk stayed to live with his mother and her husband Dirk Marshall Williams Jr.</p><p>Boonk grew up being physically active, as he participated in numerous sports including baseball, football and basketball, while he also ran track. He was somewhat popular in his high school due to his interests, but it was around third grade that he completely turned and started stealing and causing problems. His grades became very bad and he stopped playing sports, but still managed to matriculate from high school – he then found a job so that he could financially support himself, and started pursuing his career of a rapper.</p><h2><span id=Career_of_a_rapper>Career of a rapper</span></h2><p>Boonk’s career was launched in 2009 mostly thanks to his Instagram account, and he began uploading pictures of his everyday life – he was even uploading videos of himself stealing from restaurants, which eventually got him into trouble with authorities.</p><p>The account amassed more than five million followers, until it was deleted when Boonk uploaded a video of himself having sexual intercourse. Boonk was influenced by popular rappers such as Tee Grizzley, Trippie Redd and Blac Youngsta at a very young age. He released his first extended play (EP) in October 2009, entitled “Atypical Latin Groove”. His song “Muttin” was uploaded onto YouTube, and was seen more than 2.7 million times before Boonk took it down from the platform. Some of his most popular songs include “on EM” and “Black Den”.</p><p>“Boonk Gang: The Video Game” was released for android in September 2017, and was inspired by Boonk’s experiences with stealing.</p><p>In September 2018, Boonk announced that his new rap name is John Gabbana, and he changed it on all of his social media accounts. He released a couple of songs under his new name, such as “Weird Ass N!ggas” and “Either Way It Go” – his new extended play is planned to be released on 23 November 2019 and will feature numerous other popular rappers.</p><h2><span id=The_most_popular_rappers_in_the_world>The most popular rappers in the world</span></h2><p>The Ranker website has compiled the list of the most popular male rappers in the world judging by people’s votes.
