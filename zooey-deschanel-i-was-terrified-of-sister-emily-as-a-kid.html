During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live Monday, New Girl's Zooey, 32, shared some not-so-fond memories from her childhood.</p><p>"Emily's four years older, which is a very vulnerable amount of years. Because when I was 3, she was 7, and she was already evil," Zooey joked.</p><p>"She basically just used the plot of Invasion of the Body Snatchers to terrify me and a very over-the-top performance might I add. The Neptunians had killed my real sister and replaced her with a facsimile who looked just like her, talked just like her, but when my parents wren't in the room, made crazy faces at me and talked like Vickie from Small Wonder."</p><p>PHOTOS: Who's the hotter star sibling?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though she can laugh about it now, "I was terrified," Zooey recalled. "She would make me cry and then my dad would come in and try to mediate, and then she would laugh."</p><p>These days, the sisters are tighter than ever — especially after Bones' Emily, 35, gave birth son <strong>Henry</strong> (with husband <strong>David Hornsby</strong>) in September 2011.</p><p>"We shoot on the same lot, so I'll stop by her trailer," Zooey explained. "Right now [Henry] just gets excited when he sees anything that moves, so I'm really fun, because I move. He's with my sister all the time so I get to go hang out with them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaLGop5WueqWx0pyfmqaVoXqqedaaqmaslae%2FqrLInptmp5ZiwKq%2F056pZp2dnrm6ecCsZJplm56xbn6PamlrcGM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./retired-ucla-gymnast-katelyn-ohashi-issues-groveling-apology-after-being-accused-of-making-light-of.html><span>←</span><span>Retired UCLA gymnast Katelyn Ohashi issues groveling apology after being accused of making light of</span></a>
