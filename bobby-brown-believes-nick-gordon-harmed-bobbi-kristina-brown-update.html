However, the Motion was frivolous and instead of having it heard by the Court, he has chosen to withdraw the Motion, ending that matter so that he could avoid having to give his deposition which was scheduled for the day he withdrew the Motion. Mr. Gordon will now have to give his deposition under oath.”</p><p>Bobbi Kristina, the only child of Bobby and the late <strong>Whitney Houston</strong>, died at the age of 22 on July 26, six months after she was found facedown and unresponsive in her bathtub. Gordon did not attend her funeral, but later <a href=#>visited her gravesite</a> at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, N.J. On Aug. 7, Bobbi Kristina’s conservator Bedelia Hargrove filed a lawsuit claiming that Gordon gave the late star a toxic cocktail, and accused him of wrongful death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I am not shocked at the withdrawal, as we must keep in mind that Gordon filed a lawsuit to remove Bobby Brown as Bobbi Kristina’s guardian, only to withdraw that lawsuit in DeKalb County Probate Court once he was served with a deposition notice,” Christopher Brown said in his statement Monday. “He could have pressed forward with that lawsuit and told us under oath what he believed happened to Bobbi Kristina, but he chose to go in another direction.”</p><p>Bobby added: “I look forward to having the Court hear the evidence in the civil lawsuit and hopefully the criminal action very soon.”</p><p><a href=#>As previously reported,</a> a judge ordered medical examiners to not release Bobbi Kristina’s cause of death. On Monday, Christopher Brown said that the family was pleased to see that the Fulton County District made that decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmompKueqO%2BzrClZpqVobamwsSsZKehk6B6qLvRnaanZZiWv66xw2aZqJqSnnqsvsisq6KmkWKvs7vWp2SuqJSWwaZ5kWlobmpobg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angel-reese-gets-love-from-wnba-fans-despite-sky-s-loss-to-alyssa-thomas-sun-news-scores-highli.html><span>←</span><span>Angel Reese Gets Love from WNBA Fans Despite Sky's Loss to Alyssa Thomas, Sun | News, Scores, Highli</span></a>
