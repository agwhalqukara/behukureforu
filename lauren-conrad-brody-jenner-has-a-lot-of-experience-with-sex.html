The Paper Crown fashion designer dished about her good friend’s radio show, Sex with Brody, in <a href=#>Cosmopolitan’s </a>October 2015 issue.</p><p>“My husband [William Tell] told me [about it]. I didn’t know!” Conrad, 29, told the mag. Asked whether she would take his sex advice, she quipped: “He has a lot of experience … so sure, depending on what kind of advice you want.” (The former reality star and Jenner, 32, “dated” on MTV’s The Hills, but the DJ revealed back in July that their entire romantic relationship was scripted for the show, which ran from 2006 to 2010.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Conrad isn’t as open about her own sex life. In February 2014, she had the perfect response when she was asked on <strong>Sway Calloway’s</strong> <a href=#>Sway in the Morning</a> radio show what her favorite position is. “CEO,” she slyly said. Calloway shot back: “I like that! High-five! CEO. That was dope.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The former MTV star also keeps mum about her ex BFF <strong>Heidi Montag</strong>. The former roommates famously ended their friendship when Montag and her now-husband, <strong>Spencer Pratt</strong>, allegedly spread rumors that Conrad had a sex tape.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Conrad has since moved on from the fallout. Montag, however, brought up the past during an episode of Marriage Boot Camp in February, when she said she forgives Conrad for “trying to ruin” her life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“No… I’m not really involved in that anymore,” Conrad told Cosmo in response to Montag’s comment. “I don’t think it has anything to do with me.”</p><p>She added: “You just have to focus on the good people in your life. Focusing on what you lose is only going to make you sad.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOaraKau26vzqepmpxdl7%2BwsNhmoZ6mnpq%2FbrTArGSaZZykwW67xWacsaiVp7amusKeZLChpJ16tLHXZmlpaWVmhg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./judy-tenuta-net-worth-age-height-birthday-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Judy Tenuta - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</span></a>
