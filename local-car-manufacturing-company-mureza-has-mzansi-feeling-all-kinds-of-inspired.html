It says its aim is to solve transportation challenges in Africa by producing the best quality vehicles suited for conditions on the continent.</p><p class=align-left>In November, last year, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that the car company aims to separate itself from its competitors by using more human labour as opposed to robots, despite the latter being the go-to method for producing or assembling <a href=#>cars</a>.</p><p class=align-left>There was a ton of reactions to a Facebook post – which garnered over 5 000 reactions – to the company's plans to have its first batch of 100 cars released in the coming days.</p><p class=align-left>The post received more than 400 shares with just as many comments. <strong>Briefly News</strong> took a look at some of the heartwarming and inspiring comments below.</p><p class=align-left>Nyaghosaima Shimbeshe said:</p>"Wow!

I hope you receive all the support in South Africa and the world."<p class=align-left>Thokoza Dube commented:</p>"I just pray and hope they don't charge us an arm and both legs like the [other] car manufacturers are doing."<h2>Mzansi feeling inspired by one man’s hustle: "I hustle hard"</h2><p class=align-left>It is a sight to see when someone puts all excuses aside in pursuit of a dream. It is an even more glorious sight to see it all working out for them after they spilt their guts for such a pursuit.</p><p class=align-left>There is the story of one such man who blocked out all the noise and gunned for what in his books translates to the ultimate source of contentment; hustling. What form of hustle, you ask?</p><p class=align-left>The answer is poultry farming.
