The Mets are quickly falling out of contention, but that doesn't mean they won't be active on the trade market with an eye on upgrading the roster for 2025 and beyond.

New York Mets</b></p><p><i>Record: 22-33, fourth in NL East</i></p><p><i>SP ERA: 4.36, 22nd in MLB</i></p><p>The Mets are quickly falling out of contention, but that doesn't mean they won't be active on the trade market with an eye on upgrading the roster for 2025 and beyond. They made a similar forward-looking move at the 2019 trade deadline when they acquired Marcus Stroman despite a sub-.500 record. However, the luxury tax implications this time around are a significant hurdle.</p><p><b>9. Houston Astros</b></p><p><i>Record: 24-32, third in AL West</i></p><p><i>SP ERA: 4.82, 27th in MLB</i></p><p>The Astros have some work to do climbing back into contention, and at this point it's more likely they are sellers at the deadline with guys like Alex Bregman, Kyle Tucker and Framber Valdez potentially on the move as part of a major retooling. If they do decide to buy, starting pitching will be at the top of their shopping list, and the flawed nature of this year's team should take rental arms off the table.</p><p><b>8. St. Louis Cardinals</b></p><p><i>Record: 27-27, third in NL Central</i><i></i></p><p><i>SP ERA: 4.26, 20th in MLB</i><br></p><p>With Lance Lynn and Kyle Gibson both signed to one-year deals and Steven Matz playing in the third season of a four-year deal, the Cardinals rotation will be in a state of flux once again this offseason. They have clawed back to a .500 record and could hang around in the wild-card picture, and they have a lot of controllable MLB-ready pieces which is something the Marlins have prioritized in many of their recent trades.</p><p><b>7. San Diego Padres</b></p><p><i>Record: 30-29, third in NL West</i></p><p><i>SP ERA: 4.12, 17th in MLB</i></p><p>The Padres rotation is finally at full strength now that Joe Musgrove has returned to join Yu Darvish, Dylan Cease, Michael King and Matt Waldron. but a general lack of quality depth behind that group could make them players for Luzardo. The Padres have not been shy about trading away their top prospects, so they should be able to put together a competitive offer if they're interested.</p><p><b>6. Chicago Cubs</b></p><p><i>Record: 28-28, second in NL Central</i></p><p><i>SP ERA: 3.47, 7th in MLB</i><br></p><p>The starting rotation might not look like a pressing need for the Cubs, but there are question marks. Justin Steele has regressed from his terrific 2023 numbers, Kyle Hendricks has been demoted to the bullpen, Jameson Taillon has a long history of injuries and Javier Assad has a <a href=# rel=noopener>3.85 FIP</a> backing his 2.17 ERA. Another frontline arm to slot alongside Shōta Imanaga could go a long way, and they have the prospect capital to make a big move.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmh9dXyMppirpJmjwG6%2Fz2ahnqulqHqtwdmaqZ2no2LBsLyMpZinnJmjtG6%2Fz6irrGWRoralecuaq56rpGK6ra6MramanJViv7a5zquq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindsay-buckingham-bio-wkyc-age-family-husband-height-net-worth-salary.html><span>←</span><span>Lindsay Buckingham Bio, WKYC, Age, Family, Husband, Height, Net Worth, Salary</span></a>
