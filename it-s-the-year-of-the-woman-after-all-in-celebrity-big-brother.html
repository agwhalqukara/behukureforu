We’ve laughed with him, cried with him and sometimes sneered at his inappropriate jokes and Daniel really showed us his true gentle and vulnerable persona behind his stage facade. He’s everything a Big Brother Housemate and we must add a big congratulation to him and his fiance, whom he proposed to live on air, during his chat with Emma Willis. All together now, awww!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>He's saying goodbye to the <a href=#>#CBB</a> House but <a href=#>@dapperlaughs</a> is still smiling.
