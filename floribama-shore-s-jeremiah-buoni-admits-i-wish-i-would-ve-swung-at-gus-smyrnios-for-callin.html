If I feel a certain way that’s how it’s gonna come,” he continued, as Kirk agreed and attempted to calm his friend down.</p><p>His <a href=#>emotional rant</a> followed a tense moment from the episode prior, where Gus violently threw a red solo cup filled with beer against the wall, as he criticized Jeremiah as “fake as f**k” and condemned his two friends for letting him back in.</p><p>Later in this weeks episode, Codi sat down with Jeremiah, as they discussed his strained relationship with Gus.</p><p>“I just felt like there was tension,” he stated, as Jeremiah agreed: “There’s always going to be tension.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000646230063.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000639850333.jpg><p>“I’ve been having a great time, especially since Gus has been gone but now that he’s back in the house it’s throwing a wrench into a lot of my plans.</p><p>“For me I’m just having to take a step back cause every time I look at him I just think man I really wish I would’ve swung on you,” he confessed.</p><p>“Telling myself that he’s not worth it helps me get through it, especially now that I have my roommates at my back.”</p><p>The two frenemies came into season four “with more tension than there’s ever been,” Gus told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HollywoodLife</a> last month, adding: “It’s at an all-time high.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000646229931.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000642131435-1.png><p>Prior to 2019, the TV personalities were very close, and Gus even moved to Arizona to live with Jeremiah and his brothers.</p><p>The pair had a huge falling out in season three, and it only escalated at the end of <a href=#>Floribama</a> filming.</p><p>“The whole conversation that me and Jeremiah had when we were leaving [season three] — all of that was a facade, completely,” Gus told the outlet.</p><p>“I was blindsided when we wrapped filming last year and I flew back to Arizona. There was talk that they were going to kick me out because Jeremiah wasn’t cool with me living there after all the altercations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000640625555-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000646230065.jpg><p>“But [his brother] told me, ‘You and Jeremiah may have these issues, but just know we still look at you as family, we’re not just going to throw you out on the street.’ And I kind of trusted that,” he admitted.</p><p>“I did plan on moving out, but I wanted to plan and figure out what my next step was first. But the same day I flew back, somebody had already moved into the room I was still paying rent on and they packed all my stuff in boxes.</p><p>“I had to pack everything up and drive back from Arizona the same day I got back from filming. They didn’t give me the respect of giving me time to figure it out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000646230064.jpg><p>In last week’s episode Gus returned from a three day trip still feeling the negative emotions towards his cast mate.</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KH-COMPOSITE-KATE-GARRAWAY-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="teaser-slug__copy t-p-background-color">Exclusive</span></p><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">KATE’S MIRACLE</h3><p>Kate Garraway’s husband HOME after a year in intensive care battling Covid</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aj-fbanalytic-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">VERY ENGLISH SCANDALS</h3><p>Alice Levine to front new podcast exploring high-profile UK scandals</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aj-emmerdale-village-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">BRUTAL AXE</h3><p>Emmerdale director reveals ‘badly behaved’ star was written out of soap</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aj-jude-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">hook can it be?</h3><p>A-list actor is snapped playing Captain Hook – you’ll never guess who it is</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/22287405-high_res-eastenders-april-june-2021.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="teaser-slug__copy t-p-background-color">Spoiler</span></p><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">SISTER ACT</h3><p>EastEnders’ Nancy threatens to feed Sharon her own hair in explosive new trailer</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/COMP-CFP-KEITH.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">‘cheer up’</h3><p>Shocked Eamonn Holmes told to ‘stop moaning’ about chronic pain by Keith Lemon</p><p>“I feel like the stuff that happened, that’s sort of crossing a line,” Jeremiah shared.</p><p>“Coming into the house, I felt like he crossed that line.
