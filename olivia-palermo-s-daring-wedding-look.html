After more than six years of dating, Palermo and long-time boyfriend Johannes Huebl, exchanged vows in an intimate New York ceremony this weekend in front of just a few family and friends. The couple’s engagement sparked curiosity over what the bride (and groom) would wear on their big day, considering both come from the fashion industry. While Huebl, a German model and face of many bridal campaigns, went with a traditional look, Palermo’s choice might come as a surprise.</p><p>In a blog entry this weekend, Palermo made a point of telling her readers that while big princess gowns are lovely, they’re not her personal style. Instead, the fashionista decided to go as far from princess bride as possible and created her own wedding look out of a few separate pieces all by famed designer Carolina Herrera.</p><p>Palermo chose a cashmere sweater in a pale shade of cream with a few artistically placed ostrich feathers to pair with cream shorts. She added a bit of bridal flair to her uber-casual bridal look by adding a tulle skirt over the shorts. In keeping with true bridal tradition, Palermo did go for something blue; the gorgeous blue Manolo Blahnik heels Carrie Bradshaw famously wore to her courthouse wedding to Mr. Big in the first Sex and the City movie.</p><p>As far as hair and makeup, the reality star went the simple route. She wore her hair in a simple ponytail and went easy on the makeup. The look was, overall, very casual. Huebl, on the other hand, was full-on bridal. He chose to wear a white Marc Anthony Hamburg suit with a few blue accessories to match his bride, including an Etro pocket square and a tie by Charvet to complete his look as the groom.</p><p>(Photo by Dominique Charriau/Getty Images for Chloe)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGimpaGmnq5uvMClnKuln6h6pa3RoqWgZaeasaW1zaBkpaefoHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-the-wives-the-american-singer-has-had.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Wives the American Singer Has Had</span></a>
