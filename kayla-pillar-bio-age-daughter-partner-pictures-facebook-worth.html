A stroll on her Instagram page will bring you to a <a href=#>world</a> of dogs and horses. She even describes herself as a “Dog mum AF, Horse Trainer, and Nature Lover” in her bio. Kayla scarcely talks or posts about anything apart from her affection for animals, which is quite enormous.</p><h2>Kayla Pillar bio summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Full name: </strong>Kayla Pillar</li><li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>24th of April, 1987</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 34 years old</li><li><strong>Place of birth:</strong> United States of America</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Profession</strong>: Digital influencer, animal trainer, and Instagram celebrity</li><li><strong>Height</strong>: 5 feet and 6 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 62 kilograms</li></ul><h2>Who is Kayla Pillar?</h2><p class=align-left>Not much is known about Kayla Pillar's childhood, except that she was born in the United States of America.
