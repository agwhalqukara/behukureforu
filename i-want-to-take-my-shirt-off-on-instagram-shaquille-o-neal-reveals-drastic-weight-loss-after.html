At his largest, it was said that the former MVP even played at a whopping 415 pounds.</p><p>“I was getting chubby and couldn’t even walk up the stairs,” said O’Neal. “I didn’t like the way I looked in the mirror.”</p><p>Shaq began sharing details about his <a href=#>weight-loss</a> journey last December but he recently stepped on a scale and now he’s somewhere around the 350-pound range. He said he’s not done yet as he proclaimed, “I’m probably gonna get between 315 and 330.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shaq was 400 lbs and could barely run up and down the court <a href=#>https://t.co/5cCRTiRTQh</a></p>— Deep Water Carter (@LileeSosa) <a href=#>June 5, 2023</a></figure><p>If he can get down to 315, he would be back at his Miami Heat championship playing weight.</p><p>He said his new goal is “to take my shirt off on Instagram one last time.

Fans called him a “beast” after noticing his muscular frame.</p><p>“Yeah Buddy, looking BIG like me back in the day bro.”</p><p>“The tank rip was effortless.”</p><p>“Shaq, why couldn’t you be like this in 2003-2004? You and Kobe could have won 5 straight! SMH.”</p><p>“Shaq on them egg whites and avocado kidddd.”</p><p>As shared previously, O’Neal’s weight-loss journey started when a friend called him fat and told him to get his blood work done. “I didn’t know what the difference between a carb and a protein, at 50 years old I never knew,” the 15-time all-star told “ET” earlier this year.</p><p>O’Neal credits his weight-loss journey to diet change, taking supplements, and shakes, and going to the gym regularly. When asked where he wants to get to, he said he wants to get “a twelve pack. I got a five pack now, so I have seven more packs to go.”</p><p><a href=#>CLICK HERE TO SEE BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS.</a></p><p>In addition to sharing on the topic of bettering himself, O’Neal also expressed that he plans to do better at helping the lives of underprivileged children with his third-annual fundraiser for the Shaquille O’Neal Foundation and the Boys and Girls Club.</p><p>O’Neal said he’s putting together a function <a href=#>called</a> The Event, where his guests will enjoy a gourmet meal, and participate in a live auction, followed by a star-studded concert. The Event takes place on Oct. 7 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, and all the proceeds will go to children in need.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49yZmlsX6i1or3UoqOlnV2ku6aty2apnq6Vlrm0ecOrmKysmZh6doGMpZlmr5WetKnAjKWmrKtdnbJuu82cnGabn6q5pbrTZq6apJtiwrF506GcZquklrazv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-login-to-smile-network-or-contact-customer-care-for-help.html><span>←</span><span>How To Login To Smile Network Or Contact Customer Care For Help</span></a>
