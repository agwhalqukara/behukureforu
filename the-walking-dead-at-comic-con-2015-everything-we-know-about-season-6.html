If it were up to The Walking Dead star <strong>Andrew Lincoln</strong>’s parents, the fan-favorite dream pairing would actually happen in real life.</p><p>"My mom is desperate for Rick and Michonne to get together,” Lincoln dished at the show’s 2015 San Diego Comic-Con panel in Hall H on Friday, July 9.</p><p><a href=#>In addition to an ultra-intense trailer</a>, the cast and executive producer <strong>Scott Gimple </strong>spilled plenty of details about the upcoming sixth season of the AMC hit. Read on for everything you need to know about the new season (so far), plus more cast tidbits!</p><p><strong>Flashbacks!</strong></p><p>According to Gimple, there are flashbacks aplenty in the first half of the season, and he’s working on an entire flashback episode.</p><p><strong>Morgan’s Back Story</strong></p><p>We will learn what Morgan (<strong>Lennie James</strong>) has been doing for the past few years, James revealed. "We may find out what Morgan's been doing with himself, where he's been,” he said.</p><p><strong>Candy Crush</strong></p><p><strong>Norman Reedus</strong>, aka Daryl Dixon, gets into character with "A lot of Motorhead, a lot of coffee. I play Candy Crush a lot." No, seriously. “I’m so into it, it’s ridiculous. I spent hundreds of dollars on it, I don’t even care.”</p><p><strong>Abraham’s Future</strong></p><p>There’s more to <strong>Michael Cudlitz</strong>’s character than we’ve seen so far. His “defining moment is yet to come,” the actor teased.</p><p><strong>Carol’s Next Move</strong></p><p>As evidenced in the trailer, a major theme of Season 6 is shifting alliances. Carol will also figure out what she stands for in the new episodes. "She can't stand around and watch people die. She's ready to pay the price or go to hell to try to help,” <strong>Melissa McBride</strong> revealed.</p><p><strong>There in Spirit</strong></p><p><strong>Lauren Cohan</strong> (aka Maggie) couldn’t make the panel because she was visiting family, but her on-screen husband <strong>Steven Yeun</strong> read a text to the 6,000-strong crowd calling the cast her second family and thanking fans for their support.</p><p><strong>The Wire Connection</strong></p><p>You haven’t seen your last TWD-The Wire crossover — showrunner Gimple said he tried to cast another of the HBO hit’s actors for an arc in Season 6, but the scheduling didn’t work out. But it could happen again in the future. “We're not through with that cast yet,” Gimple said. The Wire alums <strong>Chad Coleman</strong>, <strong>Larry Gilliard Jr.</strong>, and <strong>Seth Gilliam</strong> have all guested on TWD.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>New Faces</strong></p><p><strong>Ethan Embry</strong> pops up in the Season 6 trailer, and executive producer <strong>David Alpert</strong> announced on the panel that Emmy winner <strong>Merritt Wever</strong> (Nurse Jackie) will guest star as a character from the comics.</p><p>The Walking Dead returns to AMC at 9 p.m. ET on Sunday, Oct. 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOrZ%2BeZaeWuay1zaBknZ2RmXqiwIycpqahk2KwsLqMa2dqbV2aw6a%2B2K2foqaXYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMrJyaq5%2Bjend5kWlobmlgbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pete-wentz-meagan-camper-welcome-baby-boy.html><span>←</span><span>Pete Wentz, Meagan Camper Welcome Baby Boy</span></a>
