Opening times and delivery advice</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>ASDA stores are open as normal while lockdown measures continue to ease.</strong></p><p>You’ll still have to follow certain rules when you’re doing your big supermarket shop. Here’s everything you need to know.</p><h3><b>⚠️ Read our</b> <a href=#><b>coronavirus live blog</b></a><b> for the latest news & updates</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000571959765.jpg><p>Supermarkets are classed as essential under the current guidance and they have been allowed to stay open throughout the pandemic.</p><p>Stores selling items deemed less important, like clothing retailers, had to remain closed during lockdown but they reopened as a raft of measures lifte on Monday.</p><h2>When are Asda branches opening and closing?</h2><p>Asda opening times vary depending on your location, so it’s best to check with your local store for exact hours.</p><p>For example, Asda Leamington Spa is open from 7am to 11pm during weekdays, whereas Asda Rugby is open from 6am to 10pm over these days.</p><p>Some stores are also back to running 24 hours on some days, such as Asda Park Royal, which is open 24 hours from Tuesday to Friday.</p><p>You can use <a href=#>Asda’s store locator tool</a> to find the latest opening times.</p><p>The supermarket introduced early closures last year so staff could restock shelves and clean stores.</p><p>At the same time, Asda temporarily reduced its normal opening hours for most stores to 8am – 10pm Monday to Saturday.</p><p>It also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">temporarily closed its 24 hour stores early</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000579411148.jpg><h2>Does Asda have any special opening hours?</h2><p><a href=#>Asda</a> put in place priority shopping hours for NHS staff, carers and care workers every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8am to 9am in larger stores during the first lockdown.</p><p>It also allocated Sundays from 9am to 10am for browsing.</p><p>These priority shopping times are still being offered while we remain in lockdown three.</p><p>But as lockdown measures are easing, some shops might not be running browsing times on a Sunday anymore, so it’s best to check ahead with your local store.</p><p>Asda has no dedicated hours set for the elderly and vulnerable who wish to shop in store.</p><p>However, it has a special <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Volunteer Shopping Card</a> for those shopping for these groups to help minimise risk and make paying for someone else’s groceries easier.</p><h2>When is the best time to shop there?</h2><p>Google has a tracker which allows you to see when the peak times are.</p><p>If you search for “Asda” and then click on your nearest store, it will show a bar chart of when the store’s busiest times are.</p><h2>What should I buy when I’m there?</h2><p>The government and supermarkets have urged shoppers not to panic buy or stockpile.</p><p>Asda is also advising customers not to touch items unless you’re planning to buy them.</p><h2>Is there a limit on items?</h2><p>During the first lockdown, the supermarket only allowed customers to purchase a maximum of three items covering all food, toiletries and cleaning products.</p><p>Asda has said that it may occasionally place limits on certain products that are high in demand to ensure there is enough to go round.</p><p>Limits can vary between stores, depending on the manager’s discretion.</p><p>You can easily check as these items will be clearly labelled, and customers will be unable to scan more than the item limit when they reach the till.</p><h2>Can I order online?</h2><p>Asda is open for online shopping, including both home delivery and click and collect.</p><p>But the supermarket has had to make some changes to the way shoppers order because of a spike in demand for the service.</p><p>Shoppers flocked online at the beginning of this lockdown, which resulted in customers claiming <a href=#>delivery slots were “running out”.</a></p><p>The supermarket has also been providing its most vulnerable shoppers with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Delivery Pass</a> to help book home deliveries.</p><p>These are currently unavailable online due to the high demand.</p><p>If you’re having trouble booking a delivery, Asda has recommended to check in regularly as it works to increase the number of slots available.</p><p>Delivery from Asda ranges from between £1 and £6.50, depending on the time and day you choose.</p><p>Next-day click and collect starts from 50p on orders over £25.</p><p>If you spend under £25, you’ll be charged £4.</p><h2>How is Asda enforcing social distancing rules?</h2><p><span>Asda is taking the following steps to comply with government social distancing advice:</span></p><ul><li><span>Asda will refuse entry to customers who do not cover their nose and mouth while shopping.</span></li><li><span>Shoppers have been ordered to keep two metres away from each other and staff.</span></li><li><span>Customers are requested to make contactless payments wherever possible and only touch items they intend to buy.</span></li><li><span>Customers with a continuous cough, temperature or shortage of breath are asked not to enter Asda stores.</span></li><li><span>Hand sanitiser, equipment cleaning materials and disposable gloves have been made available to online delivery drivers.</span></li><li><span>Delivery drivers will maintain a 2m distance at all times while delivering your shopping.</span></li><li><span>Floor markings have been placed 2m apart across checkouts, self-scan, kiosks, pharmacy, optical and service desks to help customers observe social distancing.</span></li><li><span>The number of customers in stores is limited at any one time so social distancing can be observed.</span></li><li><span>All in store and online delivery workers are supplied with hand sanitiser. Additionally, checkout and online delivery colleagues are given gloves, while pharmacy and optical colleagues are supplied with face masks to wear during consultation when required to be within 2 metres of a patient.</span></li><li><span>Perspex screens have been placed at checkouts and kiosks to protect checkout staff.</span></li><li></li></ul><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AS-Comp-Sun-Savers-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">SUN SAVERS</h3><p>Have your cake jar and eat it with our top tips on the new sweet trend</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000647412335.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">AUCTION STATIONS</h3><p>House in Wales on sale for just £12,000 – but wait until you see inside</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000647419902.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">GAS-LIGHTED</h3><p>Hundreds of British Gas engineers left furious after losing their jobs</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000645938559.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">RETAIL WOES</h3><p>Asda to axe 1,200 jobs at its bakeries under major restructuring plans</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000314390892.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">NO CREDIT</h3><p>Half a million on Universal Credit have had benefits cut by surprise tax bill</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000639651772-4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">NOT FINE</h3><p>Martin Lewis warns drivers should check photo licences NOW or risk £1,000 fine</p><p>Here are the latest <a href=#>supermarket lockdown rules for Tesco, Asda, Aldi, Morrisons, Lidl, Sainsbury’s and M&S</a>.</p><p>Supermarkets have remained open because they are <a href=#>classed as essential shops</a>&nbsp;under&nbsp;<a href=#>lockdown rules</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Asda has announced that it will <a href=#>axe 1,200 jobs at its in-store bakeries</a> under major restructuring plans.</p><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Crowd of shoppers panic-buy toilet roll in Asda on Old Kent Road due to coronavirus fears</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp52utXnToqSeZZSksrR5wKybmmWfpbKvedOom5qxXaS9prrIp55mrJmisrR5wKebZpyVoba3sdGyZJqcpp6wpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stroke-neck-cracking-could-trigger-a-stroke-warns-expert.html><span>←</span><span>Stroke: Neck cracking could trigger a stroke, warns expert</span></a>
