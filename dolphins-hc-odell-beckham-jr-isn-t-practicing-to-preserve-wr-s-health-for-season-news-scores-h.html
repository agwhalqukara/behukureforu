But systematically what we try to do is learn the player and develop a relationship with them and adjust to their body on their timeline so we can have the most beneficial, communicative relationship of maintaining health. Long story short, working into playing with the Miami Dolphins, between myself and [head athletic trainer] Kyle [Johnston] we decided you guys were going to have to wait. But that's just due to the individual process that we are very consistent with when new guys come to the team. We take nothing of assumption and make sure when guys are on the field, there's no setbacks. We're obviously applying that to him.<p>Beckham saw his once-promising career derailed by injuries. He has not played a full season since 2019 but was largely healthy in a 14-game stint with the Baltimore Ravens in 2023. The veteran wideout compiled 35 receptions for 565 yards and three touchdowns, numbers that all but confirmed his time as an impact receiver is over.</p><p>"I feel like I used to carry a lot of anger or resentment or whatever it was. Now I just feel at peace," Beckham <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> at his introductory press conference. "You're able to train, you're able to play the game that you love again. You kind of get past all the business side or whatever could be holding you back. A part of me feels like this is an opportunity for it to just be football."</p><p>The Dolphins signed Beckham this offseason to play behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle on the depth chart. It's likely Beckham will only see the field in three-wideout sets, which could help preserve him even more over the long term.</p><p>Even Beckham's teammates are champing at the bit to see him on the field.</p><p>"I can't wait, man. Like I said, when I was in high school, these guys were getting it done in the league," Waddle said. "So I was a fan of OBJ, I was a fan of Tyreek Hill. They're like the head honchos of the pass era, so playing with them, the kid in me is going to be kind of excited."</p><p>Beckham had five 1,000-yard seasons in his first six years in the NFL but has just 1,421 yards since the start of the 2020 campaign. Miami's high-profile offense has enough weapons without Beckham being relied upon for major snaps, but he'll be a fun tool to break out occasionally if he can still flash athleticism at age 31.</p><p>Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa led the NFL in passing yards last season. Beckham said he's excited to be in the wide receiver room with Hill and Waddle, believing they will "push each other" to the next level.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiEen%2BMnaalqJieu7R5x5xkqJyVoblursScoqGZnWK3s3nIrKWtZaCnrqTAyJygp59dqbxuvNGeqp6qppp6uL7SZp%2BemZyptW6yzqtkrJ2RqLyv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bernard-ambrosino-obituary-remembering-bernard-ambrosino-master-chef-at-silver-fox-steakhouse-casp.html><span>←</span><span>Bernard Ambrosino Obituary: Remembering Bernard Ambrosino Master Chef At Silver Fox Steakhouse, Casp</span></a>
