Furthermore, The Blast claimed <a href=# title="DaBaby Gave One Fan This Amount Of Money After A Fender Bender And Punched Another Who Was Pulling His Chain In Wild Videos">DaBaby</a> recently settled a lawsuit with a concert performer who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accused him of breaching his contract.</a></p><p>The promoter said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DaBaby</a> was supposed to put on a show in front of his fans, but instead, he got into a fight with someone outside and then didn’t even perform. According to the outlet, Nothing to Something ENTertainment hired him for a show in Massachusetts last year.</p><p>However, he got into a fight with a fan outside of the venue and was subsequently taken away by his security team. As a result of the suddenly canceled performance, the promoter sued DaBaby for $100,000 and the rapper sued back.</p><p>DaBaby filed a countersuit in which he accused the promotion company of failing to provide the necessary security. Nothing to Something ENTertainment claimed DaBaby’s argument was without merit because he never bothered to tell them he had arrived.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CECovOgjIXU/</p><p>According to the promotion company, DaBaby came in through the front door which is where all of his fans were waiting outside. However, artists are supposed to come in through the back that way they don’t come into contact with so many of their fans at once.</p><p>Hot New Hip Hop says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DaBaby</a> and the promotion company came to a settlement but the details of it are unclear. Either way, this is just one less legal problem the rapper has to worry about.</p><p>Fans of the Kirk artist know he has encountered trouble before. Amid the Black Lives Matter protests this year, DaBaby took to his social media to accuse people of merely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">latching onto the protests as a way of getting publicity and chasing clout.</a></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The rapper also claimed he had been a victim of police brutality a number of times in his life.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUlq%2Birthmqp6spKGytHnLmq6srZmperi106Fkqaqfory1sdFmpq%2BdomLArLXPqZydZaCav6e70aaYp5uVYq6nwMSrZKGdXZa5rbHGnpulsV2WwLSt1KWrnpxdlnqnrc1ma2txYGyDcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./currency-in-the-us-canada-and-australia.html><span>←</span><span>Currency in the US Canada and Australia</span></a>
