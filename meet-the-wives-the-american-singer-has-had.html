It lasted for nine years and they split in 1982. Billy Joel’s second marriage was to supermodel and actress, Christie Brinkley, in 1985. It also lasted for nine years before they divorced in 1994.</p><p>Ten years after his third divorce, Billy Joel got married to his third wife, Katie Lee, a budding culinary expert. The union raised a lot of eyebrows because of their 33-year age difference but they were able to make it last for five years before it bit the dust. Billy Joel is now married to Alexis Rodrick, a former hedge fund manager and they have two daughters together.</p><p>The iconic singer has certainly witnessed a lot of highs and lows but it has never made him give up on believing in true love. Another beautiful thing is that he remains on good terms with all of his ex-wives.</p><h2><strong>Billy Joel’s First Wife Was Elizabeth Weber Small</strong></h2><p>Billy Joel’s first wife is Elizabeth Ann Weber Small. She was born in 1942, making her about seven years older than Billy Joel. She is described as a person who has a shrewd head for business. She has also been described as intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind. Elizabeth Weber Small has American nationality and Caucasian ethnicity. She spent several years managing her ex-husband’s career.</p><h3><strong>Elizabeth and Joel Met and Married in the 1970s</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel first met Elizabeth Weber Small in 1970 through her husband, Jon. Jon was Joel’s band mate in a band known as Attila. This brought Joel into close proximity to Small and he was bowled over by what he saw.</p><p>Joel was impressed with the fact that Small was not interested in cooking and home economics, like most girls, but was intelligent and bold.<br>He also appreciated her seductive nature and fell in love with her.</p><p>Elizabeth Weber Small returned Billy Joel’s affections and they started dating while she was still married. They carried on the affair for some time until her husband discovered them. In the wake of the scandal, Small dumped both men and ran off.</p><p>This adversely affected Billy Joel. He was devastated by his failing career as well as the fact that he couldn’t bring anything tangible to his relationship with Small. He attempted suicide twice but survived. With the help of his family members, he started writing music again. He also got back together with Elizabeth and they wed in 1973.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Billy-Joel-Spouses-2.jpg><h3><strong>The Couple’s Marriage Lasted for Nine Years&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel’s marriage to Elizabeth Weber Small lasted for nine years. During this period, they variously lived in Los Angeles and New York City. The singer penned several songs about his wife, including She’s Got A Way, Stranger, She’s Always a Woman, and Just the Way You Are. 1977’s Just The Way You Are proclaimed that Billy Joel loved Elizabeth Weber Small just as she was.</p><p>It was a big hit and won two Grammy awards for record of the year and song of the year. On her own part, Elizabeth Weber Small not only inspired many of her husband’s songs but also took over as the management of his business a year after their marriage. She managed his career until their split and divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Billy-Joel-Spouses-3.jpg><h3><strong>Billy Joel and Elizabeth Weber Small Divorced in 1982 With Allegations that Small Was More Interested in Billy Joel’s Fortune</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel’s marriage to Elizabeth Weber Small came crashing in 1982 and friends have ascribed this to Small’s manipulative, rude and controlling nature. According to sources, she was more interested in the rock star lifestyle as well as Joel’s wealth but the singer did not fully comprehend this until an accident in 1982.</p><p>He and Small had separated shortly before the accident and he initially tried to mend things. However, when he suffered the accident that endangered his music career, Small wasn’t too concerned with this but was pressurizing him to sign his wealth over to her on his hospital bed. This made Joel realize that she didn’t really love him so much and he pushed ahead with the divorce which was finalized that same year.</p><p>Since the divorce from Billy Joel, Elizabeth Weber Small has all but disappeared from the spotlight. Her famous ex-husband has, however, revealed that he never truly loved her. He has also revealed that they are now on good terms despite the fact that he once sued Small’s brother, Frank, for allegedly <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">embezzling</a> millions from his fortune.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Billy-Joel-Spouses-4.jpg><h2><strong>Billy Joel’s Second Marriage Was to Christie Brinkley, a </strong><strong>Supermodel and Actress</strong></h2><p>Billy Joel’s second marriage was to Christie Brinkley, a supermodel, and actress who was quite popular back in the day. Brinkley, a native of Michigan, began her modeling career at the age of 19 (in 1973) in Paris. She would go on to enjoy several decades of success.</p><p>During this period, she appeared on the cover of over 500 magazines, including Esquire, Vogue, Rolling Stone, Cosmopolitan, etc. She also scored endorsement deals with numerous brands, including cosmetics company, CoverGirl. Christie Brinkley has also appeared in several movies and TV shows to date, including Parks and Recreation, and The Goldbergs.</p><h3><strong>Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley Began Dating in 1983 and Wed in 1985</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley first ran into each other while vacationing in St. Barts in early 1983. There was an instant mutual attraction between them, but they did not begin dating until they returned to New York. Joel <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">helped</a> Brinkley cope with the death of a former boyfriend while she also helped him deal with his first divorce.</p><p>Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley dated for two years during which their relationship blossomed. They later got engaged and wed in April 1985. The private wedding ceremony took place aboard a magnificent Yacht and the couple exchanged I Do’s before their closest friends and loved ones.</p><h3><strong>Their Marriage Lasted for Nine Years During Which They Welcomed a Daughter, Alexa Ray Joel</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel’s marriage to Christie Brinkley lasted for nine years. During this period, they welcomed one child together, a daughter named Alexa Ray Joel, who was born on the 29th of December 1985. They made their home in New York and tried to live as normal a life as possible. This was however difficult as they were the ultimate power couple. They attracted much media coverage and had no choice but to learn to live with it.</p><p>Just like he had done during his first marriage, Billy Joel wrote several songs for his beloved wife and one of them was the 1983 hit, Uptown Girl. It was quite a big hit and Brinkley even appeared in the video. Billy Joel also defended his wife from the critics. Many tried to stereotype her as a dumb blonde given her beauty and occupation as a model but Joel wasn’t having it. He made it known to everybody that she wasn’t vapid, shallow, or dumb.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Billy-Joel-Spouses-5.jpg><h3><strong>They Divorced in 1994 Reportedly as a Result of Joel’s Busy Schedule</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley were able to make their marriage work for nine years. They later filed for divorce in 1994 and this led to a whole lot of media speculations. Some insinuated that Joel had cheated on Brinkley but he denied it. Other sources pointed out that the split was a result of career demands. Joel had been financially cleaned out by his first wife and her brother and so toured aggressively to make money.</p><p>Brinkley was none too happy with the fact that her husband wasn’t <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">home</a> much. She equally wanted to move back to the west coast i.e. California. In the end, the couple filed for divorce in the spring of 1994 and it was concluded that same year. The terms of the divorce were sealed, making it difficult to know how they split their properties as well as custody of their then-eight-year-old daughter.</p><h3><strong>Billy Joel and Christi Brinkley Remain Very Good Friends Till Date</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley remain great friends to date. For instance, when Billy Joel got married for the third time in 2004, Brinkley attended the nuptials and gave her blessings. When Brinkley divorced her fourth husband, Peter Cook, in 2008, Joel supported her through the bitter split. Christie Brinkley also congratulated Billy Joel when he got married for the fourth time and also when he and his fourth wife welcomed more kids.</p><p>In 2019, Christie Brinkley revealed that she and Billy Joel still got together every Christmas season for a sing-along. This cordial relationship has positively impacted the couple’s daughter who is now a budding singer, songwriter, and TV personality.</p><h2><strong>Billy Joel’s Third Wife Was Katie Lee, a </strong><strong>Culinary Star</strong></h2><p>Another ex-wife that Billy Joel has a good relationship with is his third wife – Katie Lee. Lee is a well-known cookbook author and TV star. She is a native of West Virginia and studied food science and journalism in college. She has worked for several restaurants, gourmet food, and wine stores. She has also penned multiple cookbooks. Katie Lee has also hosted multiple TV shows, including Food Network’s The Kitchen and Cooking Channel’s Beach Bites with Katie Lee.</p><h3><strong>Billy Joel and Katie Lee Started Dating in 2003 and Got Married the Following Year</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel first ran into Katie Lee in the<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> lobby</a> of the Peninsula Hotel in New York City in 2003. Lee was still in college at the time and had come to the city for a weekend getaway. She and Billy Joel got talking.</p><p>They found each other interesting and they started dating. When Lee finished school, she moved into Joel’s home in the Hamptons. The couple’s relationship was fodder for a lot of gossip given the fact that Joel was 33 years older than Lee.</p><p>Many insinuated that she was using him for social climbing. Others insinuated that she was there for his money. The couple was unperturbed though. Lee helped Joel deal with his drinking problems and rejig his career. They later got engaged and wed at Billy Joel’s Long Island home in 2004. The wedding had several celebrities in attendance, including the likes of Donald Trump and Alec Baldwin. Joel’s daughter, Alexa served as a maid of honor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Billy-Joel-Spouses-6.jpg><h3><strong>Their Marriage Lasted For Five Years and They Divorced in 2009</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel and Katie Lee were married for five years. During this period, Lee worked hard to carve out an identity for herself asides from being Billy Joel’s wife. She pursued her career in the culinary world just as Joel similarly pursued his. The couple thrived in many aspects and Joel went on to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pen</a> a song for Lee in 2006 titled All My Life. Joel and Katie Lee had a good thing going by all accounts but they later split in 2009.</p><p>Sources close to the couple blamed the split on their 33-year-age difference. According to them, Lee loved the city and loved going out while Joel preferred staying at home with his motorcycles and boat when not touring. Another factor that played a role in the couple’s split was Katie Lee’s budding <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">friendship</a> with Israeli fashion designer, Yigal Azrouel. They spent a lot of time together and this grated on Joel’s nerves.</p><p>Billy Joel and Katie Lee’s divorce was finalized in 2009. The couple had a prenup and this regulated their sharing of property. Lee did not go away empty-handed though but got a generous divorce payout, including a multi-million dollar townhouse in New York. She sold the house for $11.65 million in 2011.</p><p>Billy Joel and Katie Lee remain on good terms. When Joel welcomed his second child with then-girlfriend Alexis in 2015, Lee congratulated him. She described him as a great guy and a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">terrific father</a> who deserves all the happiness in the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Billy-Joel-Spouses-7.jpg><h2><strong>Billy Joel’s Current Wife is Alexis Roderick, a&nbsp;</strong><strong>Former Hedge Fund Manager</strong></h2><p>Billy Joel is now married to Alexis Roderick, a former hedge fund manager who is 32 years his junior.

They later acknowledged it in December 2010.</p><p>Billy Joel and Alexis Roderick were in a relationship for five years before they got married in a surprise ceremony held in Long Island on the 4th of July 2015. Their loved ones came out expecting the annual Independence Day celebrations but got so much more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/Billy-Joel-Spouses-1.jpg><h3><strong>They Now Have Two Daughters and Live Out of the Spotlight</strong></h3><p>Billy Joel and Alexis Roderick have two daughters together.
