Her progression as an artist has been hailed by fans, critics, and her contemporaries as well. Additionally, the Toronto-native, Drake, shouted out to Kehlani.</p><p>He posted a headline on his Instagram Story which claimed he played a crucial role in the album’s title. The rapper said on the ‘Gram that the title of the article should be “Kehlani drops a life soundtrack,” rather than suggesting that he played a role in it. One of Drake’s producers, Boi1da, also helped Kehlani with her new project.</p><p>Drake has never stopped appearing in the headlines, however, in recent news, his child has been the subject a lot more. During an appearence on Young Money Radio, Drake explained what it was like to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">become a father for the first time in addition to new music.</a></p><p>As it was previously reported, Drake tried to keep his personal life under wraps as people began speculating that he had a baby. His child, Adonis, however, was finally revealed by Drake and his baby momma, Sophie Brussaux.</p><p>Fans of the rapper will remember when Drake revealed a photo of his toddler on his IG back on the 30th of March. Drake stated it “was great” for him to do so. According to the More Life star, it felt as though he was sharing something he loved with the world.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Drake went on to say in the interview that he woke up one morning and decided it was just something he wanted to do. He wants to go places with his son.</p><span><a href=# rel=prev><img width=150 height=27 alt="Next Article" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUp66ssYyjpqShnpy5unnCqKmrnZOpwG6t0a2gnKSVYsC1rdOipaBlpJ2utXnHnmShnZylsqV5yp6fpZmennqvrcyeZKGdomKura7UpmRscWRuhXl7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coffee-first-cultivated-in-yemen-nyt-crossword-clue.html><span>←</span><span>Coffee first cultivated in Yemen NYT Crossword Clue</span></a>
