Strickland is one of the most polarizing figures in the UFC; and really in all of sports. The trash-talking Strickland has no filter and is unpredictable on the microphone, making him loved by many and hated by others. On Saturday, Sept. 9, Strickland has the <a href=# rel=noopener>biggest fight of his life.</a> He will be taking on <a href=# rel=noopener>Israel Adesanya</a> at UFC 293 for the middleweight championship.</p><h2><strong>Sean Strickland's net worth in 2023 (estimate): $1 million</strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sean-Strickland-calls-for-a-title-shot-after-lopsided-beatdown-of-Abus-Magomedov-at-UFC-Vegas-76.jpg alt="sean strickland" width=1200 height=673 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>Sean Strickland's net worth in 2023 is said to be around $1 million, according to sites including <a href=# rel=noopener>Sportskeeda</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Sportslens</a>. This number would surely increase if he were able to pull off an upset victory over Israel Adesanya at UFC 293.</p><p>While he isn't the richest fighter in MMA, Strickland has done well for himself, especially considering his background. Strickland grew up in Corona, Calif., in a poor family. He had a mentally and physically abusive father. Strickland's home life made him troubled as a child. He was kicked out of every school he attended.</p><p>Strickland <a href=# rel=noopener>once said</a>, “If I wasn't in the UFC, I'd probably be cooking meth in a trailer [or] in prison.”</p><p>While it troubled him in his childhood, Strickland has always had a knack for fighting, and it has paid off in his adult life as he is one of the best middleweight fighters in the UFC.</p><p>Strickland is one of the most polarizing figures in the sport. His trash-talking is unmatched, but it has also been known to piss some fans and fighters off. Strickland will say whatever comes to his mind, even if it is controversial.</p><h2><strong>Mixed Martial Arts career</strong></h2><p>Strickland started his MMA career in King of the Cage. He never lost in the promotion, going 9-0 before winning the middleweight Championship, which he successfully defended three times.</p><p>Strickland was signed by UFC and made his debut in 2014. He won his first fight, a match against Robert McDaniel, via a rear naked choke. It is Strickland's only submission victory in the UFC.</p><p>In December of 2018, Strickland was involved in a <a href=# rel=noopener>motorcycle accident</a>. While riding his bike, he was hit by a car and knocked unconscious. He suffered numerous injuries, including knee injuries that held him out of fighting for two years.</p><p>In Strickland's return from injury, he came back better than ever. After the hiatus, Strickland won five straight fights and was catapulted towards a championship trajectory. His momentum was slowed some with back-to-back losses in 2022 (Alex Pereira and Jared Cannonier), but he has won his last two matches and is back on track.</p><p>Strickland most recently beat Nassourdine Imavov and Abus Magomedov in 2023. Now, he is being afforded a championship shot in the middleweight division against Israel Adesanya.</p><p>Strickland has a MMA record of 27-5. He is 14-5 in the UFC. <a href=# rel=noopener>Ranked as the fifth-best</a> in the middleweight division, it was somewhat surprising to see Strickland get a title shot.</p><p>Dricus De Plessis is the fighter ranked directly behind Adesanya in the 185-pound weight division, but he was <a href=# rel=noopener>unable to take the fight</a> after recovering from his last match. Strickland is the top-ranked fighter who hasn't already lost to Adesanya and was, therefore, chosen for the battle.</p><p>Strickland doesn't back down to nobody. Although he is the underdog in the fight, he has been talking up a storm in an effort to get inside of the champion's head, and he has full confidence in his chances of winning.</p><p>Strickland comes from a poor background and now has a chance to rise to the top of MMA, but were you surprised by his net worth?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnKrBpLTPqKCnrKNjsLC5jqycmqZdqMGztcKko5qmlGK7psCMsKarrJg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mpho-osei-tutu-bio-age-family-parents-nominations-awards-profiles-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Mpho Osei Tutu bio: age, family, parents, nominations, awards, profiles, net worth</span></a>
