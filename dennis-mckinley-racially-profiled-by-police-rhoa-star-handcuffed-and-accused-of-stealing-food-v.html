I had a receipt which could have easily ended her inquiry. There was a cashier that could have easily verified that I paid for everything I had. There were a number of easy resolutions that could have deescalated the unnecessary racial profiling and my detention by this officer. Instead, this Emory police officer chose to abuse her power. She chose aggression over common sense. She put her hands on her weapon, she put her hands on me, she publicly humiliated me, falsely and wrongfully accused me of stealing a sandwich and placed me in handcuffs so tight that she caused injuries to both of my wrists. I was profiled.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0bo_2RFn4L/</a></p><p>He shared a photo of the police officer, the receipt, and his injuries.</p><p>Dennis went on to say: ‘She was wrong. No apology. Just more vitriol – she blamed me for the entire situation. It was disgusting. I could have been the next hashtag because she was that aggressive. I went to see my doctor for a routine dr visit at&nbsp;@emoryhealthcare Emory hospital. Stopped to grab a sandwich. And this is what happened. It happens to us everywhere, at any time, for any reason. I can’t let this go. This is not ok.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta star is hiring none other than Michael Sterling, the husband of Eva Marcille, as counsel to take action against the woman who is responsible for the shocking situation.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmruvtdJmpJyjmaO5psWMq5icoZGhubp5z6umn6GcmrFurthmp6ikmZiybr7HqJhmq6SWv260wKebnK2Wm7KlecCnm2aZk5jCtLHDZqafZaOpsqK4yKeeZp6fpLFuwsidnKhlY2WDdYCVaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-bondar-vs-kimberly-birrell-wta-merida-open-2023-preview-schedule-date-form-guide-head-to.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Bondarvs Kimberly Birrell: WTA Merida Open 2023 Preview, Schedule, Date, Form Guide, Head to</span></a>
