<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Mel B Says She Dated a Woman for 4 Years, Recalls Spice Girls Fights</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Girl power! Spice Girls singer <strong><a href=#>Melanie Brown</a></strong>, a.k.a. Scary Spice Mel B, has had a couple of high-profile romances with men — most notably, actor <strong><a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a></strong> — but it’s her relationship with a woman that’s making headlines now. As she revealed in a recent interview with the UK’s <a href=#>Guardian</a> newspaper, she once had a long-term relationship with a mother whose children attended school with her eldest daughter, <strong>Phoenix</strong>.</p><p>“Well, I did have a four-year relationship with a woman,” Brown told The Guardian, which identified her girlfriend as Crista Parker. “But I’ve been very happily married for seven years to a penis. Ha ha! An amazing guy.” (The 39-year-old Brit tied the knot with movie producer <strong>Stephen Belafonte</strong> in 2007.)</p><p>“I’ve definitely not been shy or been one to hold back,” she added of her once-tumultuous love life. “If I wanted to try something, I did. I had a girlfriend. So what?”</p><p>These days, of course, she’s a one-man woman. “Let me put it this way, we’re just very sexually compatible in every way,” she teased of her husband, with whom she has a 3-year-old daughter, Madison Brown Belafonte. (Madison is her third child; she’s also mom to Phoenix, 15, with ex-husband Jimmy Gulzar, and Angel, 7, with Murphy.) “We think very much alike, and we get turned on by the same things,” she added.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Their marriage is “tight and solid” — but Brown still notices and appreciates beauty in other women. “I will be the first one to compliment a woman, to say to my husband, ‘Oh my God, look at her legs’; or ‘Doesn’t she look stunning?'” she told The Guardian. “I do think women are gorgeous. Crazy but gorgeous.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Speaking of gorgeous women, the America’s Got Talent judge also opened up to the paper about her time as a member of the Spice Girls. “I found my group of people that I actually fit in, who don’t judge or go, ‘What are you doing that for?'” she said of the ’90s girl band. “We complemented each other. I found my people, finally.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>They didn’t always get along, of course, but Brown recalls even their fights with some fondness. “Me and Mel C had a few punch-ups,” she admitted, noting there might have been a “split lip” or two along the way. “Me and Melanie would irritate each other. It would always start off with a shove, not a punch.”</p><p>“Mel C’s pretty hard,” she told the paper of Sporty Spice&nbsp;<strong>Melanie Chisholm</strong>. “And if she let rip…but then two seconds later we’d be rolling around laughing, going, ‘Oh, you silly bugger.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSepF2XerSt2KxkrKCVYrGiwMSdZJplp6S6orqMn6arZWRixqat0axkq52Tlrmtv4ysp6KblWK0qr7LrGSfoZedwbR5kWlobWlhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lily-james-ditches-her-blonde-wig-after-filming-pam-and-tommy-with-co-star-sebastian-stan.html><span>←</span><span>Lily James ditches her blonde wig after filming Pam and Tommy with co-star Sebastian Stan</span></a>
