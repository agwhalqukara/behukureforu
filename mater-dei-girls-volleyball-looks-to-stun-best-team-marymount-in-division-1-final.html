To me, the pressure is on their side of the net.”</p><p>O’Dell said the Monarchs have been playing their best volleyball of the season and are not the same team Marymount saw in the Durango Fall Classic.</p><p>“They haven’t played a team as good as us when we are playing the way we can play,” he said. “So, they’re going to have to be prepared to face a team that is going to be the best team that they have seen at this point.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnZbBpr6MnZyiZZeev62%2FjK%2BmpaSVrq%2BiuMtmo6inm6h6tbuMrKuupl2XsrTAjK2cmqVdoq6zxcyorKesXZ67brDIr6CsoZ%2BjenJ5xaKlmqRf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-great-chocolate-showdown-scripted-or-real.html><span>←</span><span>Is Great Chocolate Showdown Scripted or Real?</span></a>
