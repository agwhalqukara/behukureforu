It seems the pictures posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> weren't well received and the website was asked to take them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the website who wanted to break down the fiercest moments from the show received a letter from the singer's camp to take it all down, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">then promptly printed the letter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, it was on and popping, the Internet is creating memes and there ain't no stopping.&nbsp;</p><p>You see, one does not simply erase a photo from the Internet. Once you hit publish, tweet or upload, it is there for eternity, solidified like Han Solo in carbonite.</p><p>Oh, you can ask for the Internet to forget, but they never forget. I certainly hope Beyonce's publicist knew this, and was counting on the mere mention causing an even bigger wave of hype for what was a fantastic halftime show.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from that, let's go ahead and say that the pop star is obviously one of the most gorgeous people in the world. The "bad" photos were obviously cherry-picked from moments when her dance moves caused some awkward faces.</p><p>The best course of action would have been to say, we can all make silly faces and move on.</p><p>But if you ask the crazy Interwebz not to do something, they are going to push back the other way. You only have to take a gander at places like Imgur and Reddit to know that you must brace yourselves, Beyonce memes are coming.</p><p>Hit me up on Twitter for more me-me-me-memes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5qYGuBcXnHsqeeZZ%2BrsrN5wZqbZpqVrryvr8Rmqq6olad6o7vWpWSpoZOpwrOx0maqqZmno8ButMilmKuhn6rAbrDEq6dmpZWisg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./en-vogue-maren-morris-ellie-goulding-to-headline-the-2023-hilton-grand-vacations-tournament-of-cha.html><span>←</span><span>En Vogue, Maren Morris, Ellie Goulding To Headline The 2023 Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Cha</span></a>
