This panel was a part of the library’s “Chopping it Up”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series</a>.</p><p>Days following the event, actress Cree Summer took to her official Instagram account to give fans a preview of what occurred during the reunion.</p><p>Alongside behind-the-scenes clips of the cast, Summer shared a video of the group singing the iconic “A Different World’s” theme song, which was originally performed by Phoebe Snow, Aretha Franklin, and Boyz II Men, respectively.</p><p>In addition to the recordings, Summer also uploaded several photos of the cast. One appeared to have taken at the event, while another occurred at what looks to be a restaurant.</p><p>In the post that Summer shared on her Instagram page, she wrote the caption, “The Band Got Back Together @kadeemhardison @iamjasmineguy @darrylmbell@dawnn_lewis @bcharnele @wilmingtonlibraryde#godblessthefreaks #adifferentworld (camera emoji) by @elakephotos 35 Years and Still Going Strong.”</p><p>As Summer’s photos went viral, many expressed how youthful 61-year-old Dawnn Lewis, who portrayed the role of Jaleesa Vinson–Taylor, looked in the images.</p><p>“Jaleesa looks the youngest and she may be the oldest.”</p><p>“Ummm Jaleesa looks exactly the same! Love this!!! The crew!!”</p><p>“Jaleesa didn’t age at all.”</p><p>“Jaleesa ain’t aged NOT ONE DAY!!”</p><p>“Not Jaleesa looking 35.”</p><p>Among the previous responses, others brought up how much they loved the show. One wrote, “35 years!! They all look good! How is Jalisa looking 35 years old. Man I love that show.”</p><p>Another said, “One of the greatest shows of all times!” A third person stated, “The nostalgia was getting looking at this is unbelievable. One of the best shows ever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze5BpZmlrX5%2BurbHErJhmmZmjwW6txp6bZqeemnqlrdhmmGacmZuzpr7Ep6tmr5%2BnuaV5wpqqrWWimsKvtdOeqmaen6d6dIHToWSapp6ew6a%2B0pqpsmWUlsSvuoylnLCho2LAtbHApapmrJiaerS0zrBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dolphins-hc-odell-beckham-jr-isn-t-practicing-to-preserve-wr-s-health-for-season-news-scores-h.html><span>←</span><span>Dolphins HC: Odell Beckham Jr. Isn't Practicing to Preserve WR's Health for Season | News, Scores, H</span></a>
