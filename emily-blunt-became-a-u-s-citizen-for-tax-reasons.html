In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Blunt said: “I became an American citizen recently, and that night, we watched the Republican debate, and I thought, ‘This was a terrible mistake. What have I done?'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>In a separate interview with Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Blunt continued to make fun of becoming an American citizen. “I’m not sure I’m entirely thrilled about it,” the mom of baby Hazel, 19 months, joked. “People ask me about the whole day. They were like, ‘Oh, it must have been so emotional.’ I was like, ‘It wasn’t! It was sad!’ I like being British.”</p><p>After the Internet railed against the Devil Wears Prada star for her comments, a contrite Blunt apologized on the Today show.</p><p>“It was so not the intention to hurt anybody or cause any offense, so I really apologize to those that I caused offense,” she told <strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong> last month. “It was just an offhand joke. I think I’ll probably leave the political jokes to late night or something.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJymoZyueqO41KerZpqVmK6usYyaZK6rXZi2tbXZnqVmnp%2BnerWt12apnpmjpLu0eZFpaG5tYWU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dane-cook-girlfriend-kelsi-taylor-wiki-biography-age-height-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Dane Cook Girlfriend Kelsi Taylor Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Instagram</span></a>
