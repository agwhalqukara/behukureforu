Being a former girlfriend of Sean Penn has also put her on the map. Nicolette Scorsese was born under the zodiac of Capricorn on the 6th January 1954. Her nationality is American.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Family>Early Life and Family</span></h2><p>Nicolette was raised by her parents in the US with her siblings.

Nicolette began her career in the entertainment world as a model. Initially, she started appearing in television advertisements and commercials. This catapulted her career and soon enough, she was getting acting roles in movies.</p><h2><span id=Nicolette_Scorsese_Career>Nicolette Scorsese Career</span></h2><p>After she graduated from college, Nicolette began her modeling and acting career. She debuted in the TV series “The A-Team” in 1986, but her big breakthrough&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>came in 1989</a>,&nbsp;when she starred in the film “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation”, in the role of Mary.

From 1995 to 2000, Nicolette starred in the acclaimed series “NYPD Blue”.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Although her acting career was short-lived, Nicolette managed to leave a mark in people’s hearts and minds, having appeared in at least five films and several TV series, remaining in the entertainment industry for a little over a decade. However, in 2000 she silently slipped from the Hollywood limelight, stepping down from her acting career after a number of failed projects. However, Nicolette had a good run while her career lasted.</p><h2><span id=IsNicolette_Scorsese_related_to_Martin_Scorsese>Is&nbsp;Nicolette Scorsese related to Martin Scorsese?</span></h2><p>When many people hear the name Nicolette Scorsese, what&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>comes to their mind</a>&nbsp;is the famous film director Martin Scorsese; after all, they share the same surname. What they want to know is whether the two people are related. The truth is that they do not share any kind of relationship, although sharing a surname and working together. Martin Scorsese is older than Nicolette by 12 years, but he has never been married to her. Working in Hollywood is their only relationship and nothing else; while Martin has been married five times, Nicolette has never married.</p><h2><span id=Nicolette_Scorsese_Personal_Life_Dating_or_Husband>Nicolette Scorsese Personal Life, Dating or Husband</span></h2><p>Despite the success she gained in her career, Nicolette has not been so lucky with her love life. At her age, she&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>has never been married</a>, however, this does not necessarily mean that Nicolette has never dated. In 1988, Nicolette is said to have dated Jellybean Benitez. However, the couple went their separate ways after a number of months. She has also dated a number of Hollywood celebrities, for example Sean Penn back in the 1990s, appearing together publicly at the First Annual International Rock Awards, held at the NY State Armory, but union did not last long, and they went their separate ways after a year. That same year, Nicolette dated model Antonio Sabato Jr., an affair they started after she met him while pursuing her modeling career. The relationship did not go beyond that, and they also parted ways.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Nicolette was also seen on various occasions with Billy Duffy, a musician ,in the late 1990s, and the couple was rumored to be sharing a daughter, Shiloh Duffy, but the couple never confirmed the rumor, and after years of dating, they broke-up.</p><p>Apparently Nicolette is not dating anyone currently, and is also not linked to any person. Since she has always shared her love life openly in the past, it is only right to assume that she is currently single and unmarried.</p><h2><span id=Nicolette_Scorsese_Net_Worth>Nicolette Scorsese Net Worth</span></h2><p>Although Nicolette’s acting career came to an end more than a decade ago, she had made a fortune for herself. Having&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>starred</a> in popular series and movies, and appeared in many commercials and ads, means that her net worth is sufficient to help her lead a good life. All these multiple sources of income have helped Nicolette accumulate a net worth of around $300,000.</p><h2><span id=Nicolette_Scorsese_Body_Features_and_Measurements>Nicolette Scorsese Body Features and Measurements</span></h2><p>Nicolette is 5ft 4ins (1.65m) tall, is reputed to weigh 120lbs (55kgs), and her vital statistics are 35-24-34. With dark brown eyes and blonde hair. This&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>beautiful and skilled actress</a>&nbsp;was not so popular for her acting expertise, but the gorgeous hourglass figure she displayed while wearing black lace lingerie in the film “Boxing Helena” left many men with beads of sweat. Some still find it very sensual; she is still apparently a beautiful woman into her 60s. She was proud of her body enough to show these features fully on all her modeling projects and movies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunC10malopufobK1wMRmqpynoqiytLGMq5ylmaSasW7Azmakmqqknrtuv8Koqaydo5p6uLXKomSnnaRixLC%2B06FkqZmimru1v4ynmK2hn6OurbXTsmShraOXrq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natural-beauty-stars-without-makeup.html><span>←</span><span>Natural Beauty: Stars Without Makeup</span></a>
