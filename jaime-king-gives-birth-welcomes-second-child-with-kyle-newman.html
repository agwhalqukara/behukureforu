<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Jaime King Gives Birth, Welcomes Second Child With Kyle Newman</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Jaime King</strong> has a new little prince! The Hart of Dixie alum gave birth to her second child, a baby boy, late last week, she revealed via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Monday, July 20.</p><p>King, 36, announced the happy news by sharing a picture of herself nursing her newborn son while sitting next to husband <strong>Kyle Newman</strong> and their eldest child, 21-month-old James Knight.</p><p>"We are SO happy to welcome to the world our new baby boy!" she captioned the photo. "Born Thursday, July 16th! Xx"</p><p>The little one, whose name has not yet been revealed, is King and Newman's second child together. The couple announced their second pregnancy this past February — and later revealed that they had chosen the actress' BFF <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> as the baby's godmother. (<strong>Jessica Alba</strong> is James' godmother.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I always knew she was going to be the godmother if I had another baby," the Pearl Harbor actress told <a href=#>Elle.com</a> of the "Style" singer. "Choosing a godmother is a very sacred and important thing in our family…We try and choose people who we know would raise our child the way that we would raise our child, and her thoughtfulness, her kindness, her authenticity…is so powerful to me. She's so uninhibited in her giving…It's just beyond."</p><p>Case in point: Swift, 25, threw her pal <a href=#>an extravagant baby shower</a> last month, complete with a photo booth, fun costumes, and one very star-studded guest list. (Alba, <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>, <strong>Nina Dobrev</strong>, <strong>Hailee Steinfeld</strong>, <strong>Sarah Hyland</strong>, and <strong>Emma Roberts </strong>were just a few of the familiar faces in attendance.)</p><p>"How can I put this into words," King captioned an Instagram photo from the bash. "@taylorswift is not only going to be an exquisite Godmother but one of the best friends one could ask for. Thank you Tay for throwing me such an insanely beautiful baby shower. Less then 12 hours after performing for 100k strong. I love you SO MUCH xx."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGaoZ2aeqy1zaBkoKGmmsBursirq6Flp5q5pLvMnqpmq5WYvK%2BwjJyfoqSUYsSqwMdmorKklWK7psPMmqVmamBmgnN8lg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./department-store-that-recently-partnered-with-toys-r-us.html><span>←</span><span>Department store that recently partnered with Toys R Us</span></a>
