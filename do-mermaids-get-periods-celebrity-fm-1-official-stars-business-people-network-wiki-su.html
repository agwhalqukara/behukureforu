Produce, eggs maybe, but get periods, no.</strong></p><p>Thereof What are mermaid tails called? Mermaid are able to swim circles around other ocean creatures by using their powerful tails also known as <b>flukes</b>. The mermaid fluke is essentially a beautiful wing in the water.</p><p>How do mermaids make babies? How are mermaids born? Once again, assuming mermaids reproduce the way fish do, mermaid babies <b>would be born by hatching from eggs</b>. Though it is possible for mermaids to get pregnant and give live birth like dolphins.</p><p>Subsequently, How do mermaids mate? Mermaids have <b>vaginas</b>, mermen have penises in sheaths, kind of like dolphins, and male mermaids have both penises and vaginas. Q: How do merpeople have sex? When any group of merpeople love each other very much, they rub their parts against each other, sometimes inside each other, in a special, watery cuddle.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_vampires_have_a_period></span>Do vampires have a period?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>No, Vampires do not get periods because</b> they are practically dead but not dead… You know what I mean? They’re undead which means that they are also sterile. Think of them as a dead body which behaves alive….</p><p>Do mermaids poop? They <b>poo out of a hole</b>, called an ‘anus’, in their bottoms; and wee using a different hole. … Well, since a mermaid has a human top half and a fishy bottom half, I think she would poo through a vent on her tail. This would mean that she would make stringy poo like a fish.</p><p>How do I find a mermaid? Mermaids can often be found <b>near shipwrecks</b> because the wreckage is full of shiny, foreign objects they’ve never seen before. They especially love the flash of a bright gold coin, which reminds them of the way fish scales glean when hit just right by the sunlight.</p><p>How can I be a mermaid?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_can_I_become_a_mermaid></span>How can I become a mermaid?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>To become a mermaid:</b></p><li>Be a good swimmer.</li><li>Get a tail and monofin, get comfortable in it, practice swimming in it.</li><li>Work on underwater tricks.</li><li>Practice breath-hold.</li><li>Practice posing on land and in water.</li><li>Make or buy mermaid accessories for your costume.</li><p>Can mermaids talk? In most mythologies, books and motion <b>pictures mermaids can not only talk</b>, but they are very articulate and fluent in human languages, or, if they don’t know them already, are able to learn them very rapidly.</p><p>How do mermaids mate in Siren?</p><p>The males can <b>attract potential mates by stretching and twisting their necks and produce a kind of bio-luminescence</b>. Then the females bite on to their male mate’s necks and smack them with their tails. Ryn later states that males can even die from excessive mating.</p><p>What would a mermaid eat? In this fairy tale, mermaids eat <b>fish, sea vegetables and a dash of fat</b> (following the Zone Diet, of course), which is how they get their healthy and youthful appearance. As it turns out, seaweed, a primary vegetable in their diet, has numerous health benefits that could help you embrace your inner mermaid.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_mermaids_pee></span>Do mermaids pee?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mermaids are indeed monotremes. They lay eggs and lactate. And their belly buttons are actually their cloacae. <b>Mermaids pee (and poop) from their belly buttons</b>.</p><p>Do vampires like periods?</p><p>In the official guide it explains why vampires don’t react to periods. Here is the science behind it: … In conclusion, <b>vampires aren’t at all attracted to periods</b>; most of periods are not blood, and whatever blood there is, is unappetizing to vampires.</p><p>Where does a vampire sleep? Traditionally, vampires sleep <b>in coffins</b> during the day. As to where they live, rumor has it that they can be found in old castles, cellars, basements, crypts, and mausoleums.</p><p>How do you recognize a vampire? According to vampire folklore, vampires display some tell-tale physical signs of their affliction: <b>pale skin, an absence of a reflection in mirrors, fangs and red glowing eyes</b>. These attributes are commonly assigned to the blood-sucking undead in popular culture.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_mermaids_get_pregnant></span>Do mermaids get pregnant?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Once again, assuming mermaids reproduce the way fish do, mermaid babies would be born by hatching from eggs. Though <b>it is possible for mermaids to get pregnant</b> and give live birth like dolphins.</p><p>How would a mermaid pee? [TL;DR: Ariel <b>pees out of her belly button</b>.] Well now, let’s see. Since their tails are generally depicted or specified as that of a fish, not of a marine mammal, my first thought was that they would pass both waste and reproductive cells through a cloaca of some description.</p><p>Who was the first mermaid?</p><p>The earliest mermaid-like figure was likely <b>the ancient Syrian goddess Atargatis</b>, who watched over the fertility of her people, as well as their general well-being. She, too, was human above the waist and fish below it, and was accordingly associated with water.</p><p>How long does a mermaid live? According to Hans Christian Anderson, Mermaids <b>live for 300 years</b> then turn to sea foam when they die. The more realistic answer is mermaids die and like any other mammal or sea creatures, they sink to the bottom and the circle of life takes over. There are theories that sunlight and dehydration are deadly to mermaids.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_mermaids_have_powers></span>Do mermaids have powers?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In European folklore, mermaids (sometimes called sirens) and mermen were natural beings who, like fairies, had <b>magical and prophetic powers</b>. They loved music and often sang. Though very long-lived, they were mortal and had no souls.</p><p>Can mermaids talk to humans? In most mythologies, books and motion pictures mermaids can not only talk, but <b>they are very articulate and fluent in human languages</b>, or, if they don’t know them already, are able to learn them very rapidly.</p><p>Can mermaids take off their tails?</p><p></p><h2></h2><p>Don’t forget to share this post 🖤</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ksbB5zJ6pppmZmcBus8StZKmdop68pb%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./delaware-state-beats-grambling-state-71-63.html><span>←</span><span>Delaware State beats Grambling State 71-63</span></a>
