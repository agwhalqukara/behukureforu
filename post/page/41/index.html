In addition to replacing Howard at the helm, Michigan may lose as many as a handful of veteran players.
Olivier Nkamhoua, who transferred from Tennessee and ended as Michigan's second-leading scorer this season, is out of eligibility. The same goes for Jaelin Llewellyn and Tray Jackson, two more recent transfers who played important roles off the bench.
