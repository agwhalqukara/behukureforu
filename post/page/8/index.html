Jim McIsaac/Getty ImagesOriginally, the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York was created to honor the best and most important people in the game’s history. The first class of players—Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson and Ty Cobb—are some of the biggest names the game has ever seen (how Cy Young was omitted from selection that first year is baffling, given his credentials).&nbsp;
In the decades that have passed since 1936 there have been many more entrants elected to the sacred hallways of Cooperstown, most deserving the honor.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kristen Johnston- Net Worth, Age, Nationality, Boyfriend, Height, Career</h2><time>Sep 20, 2024</time>

Oh Kelsey Poe; the woman America loved to hate. The woman vying to be married to the farmer Bachelor from Iowa. The woman who made a complete fool of herself on national television and continues to do so in the press any chance she gets. We just adore the fact that she seems completely and utterly unfazed by the fact that she’s a laughingstock; it makes us happy. In case you are not watching this season of The Bachelor (shame on you), you might not be overly familiar with this fabulous, fabulous storyline.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/7/>← Prev Page</a>
