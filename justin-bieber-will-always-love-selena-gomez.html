Justin admitted that Selena did help inspire the new album and there are about&nbsp;three songs about her on there.</p><p>Talking to&nbsp;Billy Bush from Access Hollywood, Justin had a lot to say about his first love. He said that he is not sure if he is even over Selena! “It was really tough. I don’t know if I’m over it yet. I think that I’m definitely in another place and I think we’ve definitely went our separate ways. I love her and I want her to be awesome, but there are things that remind me of her.”</p><p>Justin said he wrote a song that didn’t make the album called “If I Would Have Met You In 5 Years” and he admits that he and Selena may have met too early in life. “How true is that? How many people go through life and end up meeting someone and it feels so right, but it’s just the wrong time? So many people can relate to that.”</p><p>He goes on to say that “she is someone I love dearly. I’m never going to stop loving her. I’m never going to stop checking in on her. I don’t think if you end a relationship, you should end that, unless it was super toxic and you guys were hurting each other physically or mentally. We always respected each other and we still respect each other.”</p><p>He was asked if he thinks he and Selena would ever give love another chance and he responded by saying&nbsp;“I don’t know what happens. I don’t know what is going to happen in the future. I think we both gotta do some soul searching ourselves and figure out ourselves before we can just try to figure out each other.”</p><p>You can watch Justin talk about his past behavior, his new album, and Selena Gomez <a href=#>here!</a><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/justin-bieber-will-always-love-selena-gomez-03.jpg alt="Justin Bieber Will Always Love Selena Gomez 3" width=614 height=879 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br></a>Don’t give up hope yet Jelena shippers!
