From this, can you deduce what her zodiac sign is? Clue: it’s the eighth sign in the zodiac.</p><p><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis is a Scorpio, sharing the same birthday as other celebrities like Hailey Baldwin and Scarlett Johansson, but only just. To be a Scorpio, you must be born between October 23 and November 22, so Jamie Lee just about falls into the birth range of a Scorpio.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Read more below about Jamie Lee’s zodiac sign and if her and her husband are truly compatible.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sassy Scorpios</h2><p>As the eighth astrological sign in the zodiac, Scorpio is one of the three water signs with the other water signs being Cancer and Pisces. It’s also one of the six fixed negative zodiac signs, with the other five being Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn, and Pisces.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to Cosmopolitan</a>, water signs tend to be sensitive and sentimental, with Scorpio’s described as a “transformative sign.” Their intuition is described as being so strong that they’ve essentially got psychic powers. Logic and reason come after their feelings; therefore, it’s common for them to make choices based on their feelings as opposed to what is logical.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Traits of a Scorpio</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to Astrology</a>, Scorpios “are passionate and assertive people. They are determined and decisive and will research until they find out the truth. Scorpio is a great leader, always aware of the situation, and also features prominently in resourcefulness… They are the most sensual sign of the zodiac.”</p><p>The best thing about a Scorpio is that they want to cultivate and utilize their positive energy in ways that’ll be beneficial for society. Instead of getting into fights, Scorpios are likely to go down an alternative route like becoming a boxer or something similar.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Apparently, Scorpios have gained a bad rep for overindulging in the finer (possibly not the wisest) things in life, including having addictions due to their intense, fiery personalities. This can be linked with Jamie Lee, who has overcome an addiction to drugs, and <a href=# rel=noopener>according to Horoscope</a>, Scorpios are the most capable sign in the zodiac in fighting addictions. In fact, they argue that Scorpios are the most successful in battling addictions; so perhaps Jamie Lee is a true Scorpio on the inside.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Truly Compatible? Jamie Lee and Husband Chris Guest</h2><p>Back in 1984, wedding bells chimed as Jamie Lee married the love of her life, Hollywood director Chris Guest, who was born on February 5, 1948, making him an Aquarius.&nbsp;</p><p>Taurus, Cancer, Capricorn, Pisces, and Virgo are known to be the most compatible with Scorpio. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Astrology Zodiac Signs</a>, a Scorpio and an Aquarius are only 40% compatible.&nbsp;</p><p>When the two come together, you’ve got emotions mixed with information; therefore, it can be challenging for these signs to find a balance between rational thinking, passion, and emotion. As two fixed signs, the relationship can involve a fair amount of adjustment and change to result in the best outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, the area the two signs will find common grounds in is the activities. The two signs are likely to find many things to do together and will take risks of any kind; however, with regards to trust, this can be tricky.&nbsp;</p><p>But maybe it’s not wise to base your whole opinion on relationship compatibility on what you’ve read about your star signs because clearly Jamie Lee and spouse Chris are pretty damn compatible, seeing as though they’ve been married for three and a half decades as of December 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Want to know what Jamie Lee’s key to a successful marriage is? Something short and sweet that <a href=# rel=noopener>she has said is</a>, “Don’t get divorced.” So maybe astrological compatibility doesn’t matter after all!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsButsCmoJ5lnJqybq%2FUq6uiq12vvKW1wJxkrKGXo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./our-ship-is-sinking.html><span>←</span><span>Our ship is sinking!</span></a>
