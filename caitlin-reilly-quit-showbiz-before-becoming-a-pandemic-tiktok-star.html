[TikTok] brought it back to my passion and my dreams.”</p><p>In May 2020, Reilly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a video </a>as the “co-worker you hate during a Zoom meeting,” which went wildly viral to a content-starved and captive audience in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, launching her to TikTok fame. Reilly’s subsequent videos have amassed her a 1.8 million-strong following.</p><p>And yes, she knows the tale sounds like a tired Hollywood cliché.</p><p>“I call it the Jon Hamm moment. Jon Hamm tells this story about right before he got cast in ‘Mad Men,’ he was really going to give up, and then ‘Mad Men’ changed the trajectory of his life,” she said.</p><p>“I would always hear those stories and think, ugh what hogwash, but that legitimately was my timeline.”</p><p>And Reilly has at least one non-TikTok job already lined up. She’ll be taking part in a “General Hospital” episode that will pay tribute to her <a href=#>late dad John Reilly</a>, who passed away in January 2021 and was best known for playing Sean Donely on the soap.</p><p>Meanwhile, Reilly continues garnering bold-typed fans like Dan Levy, Melissa Gilbert, and Chrissy Teigen for her TikToks.</p><p>“Gwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon follow me, and, I mean, they’re icons,” she says, sounding a little astonished. “One of my idols is Molly Shannon and she follows me on Instagram. I can’t even wrap my head around that one.”</p><p>Despite the huge exposure, Reilly is optimistically guarded about her future.</p><p>“At the end of the day, these are numbers on the internet. I know I still have a lot of work to do, and planning and auditioning and proving myself,” she explained. “I’m also flabbergasted this has happened but I don’t think my career is made.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk5a2tbjIp2SrnZmhubp50K6grWWjnby4rsizZJudlqS%2FpnnBnpqopZmjtG6tjKmYp5yVorakedOioq2nm2LAta3RaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./allie-brooke-celebsgraphy.html><span>←</span><span>Allie Brooke Celebsgraphy</span></a>
