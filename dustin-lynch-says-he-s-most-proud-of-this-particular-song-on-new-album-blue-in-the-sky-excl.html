<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Dustin Lynch Says Hes Most Proud of This Particular Song on New Album Blue In The Sky (Excl</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Dustin Lynch</strong></a>&nbsp;is in full party mode now that his new album is finally out for the world to hear!</p><p>After calling it quits with his ex-girlfriend Kelli Seymour during the <a href=#>Coronavirus pandemic</a>, Lynch took his pen to paper to cope with the heartbreak. The 36-year-old’s fifth full-length project, <strong><a href=#>Blue In The Sky</a>,&nbsp;</strong>is a compilation of songs that introduces a new chapter for the country music star, including his latest single “Party Mode.”</p><p>“I couldn’t be more proud of this album and where I’m at right now in my career,” shared&nbsp;<span class=il>Lynch in a statement</span>. “Life couldn’t look any brighter coming off the success of ‘Thinking ‘Bout You,’ and rolling into this next chapter with ‘Party Mode.’ I’m pumped for everyone to hear these songs and do some life with them.”</p><p>“Party Mode,” which is now spinning on Country Radio, has a foot-tapping beat that will instantly put you in a good mood from the moment it begins. The adult party anthem that blends both traditional and contemporary country sounds is the perfect sing-a-long for a night out at the bar.</p><p>The song’s <a href=#>music video</a>, which is out now, features Dustin along with his real-life friends Cornbread and Corbin Wilson going&nbsp;on a post-breakup getaway that he barely survives – literally. Directed by Mason Dixon, the Jerry Flowers, Ryan Beaver, Roman Alexander, Jared Keim, and Matt McGinn-penned lyrics serve it up strong as the ultimate soundtrack for a wild ride of Florida escapades.</p><p>In addition to “Party Mode,”&nbsp;Blue In The Sky&nbsp;features the recent six-week No. 1 “Thinking ‘Bout You” with <a href=#><strong>MacKenzie Porter</strong></a>, collaborations with&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Riley Green </strong></a>and<strong><a href=#> Chris Lane</a>,&nbsp;</strong>and “Pasadena” — a song that he tells Celeb Secrets Country holds a special place not only on this body of work, but also in his heart.</p><p>“I think one of the coolest moments for me as a, as a creative and just as a songwriter in Nashville is ‘Pasadena,’ Lynch tells Celeb Secrets Country host Juliet Schroder during a media session.</p><p>Written in 2013 after performing at the rodeo in Pasadena, TX, Lynch says that the meaningful tune is “a great example of now everything in [our] inbox doesn’t get picked up right away.”</p><p>“Timing is such a huge thing in this game and this wonderful creative journey we are all on,” he says. “I&nbsp;was reminded of the song when I went to write with my good buddy Busbee who passed at his studio in Pasadena, California. I was writing with him on May 6, 2019 and it just reminded me of [‘Pasadena’].”</p><p>So when Dustin was in the studio making Blue In The Sky&nbsp;with producer Zach Crowell, he brought the demo — which he says was very “bare” — to Crowell to see if it could be tweaked for the upcoming record, as he left that he resonated with it more now than he did nine years ago.</p><p>“I sent it to [Zach] and he called me immediately and was like, ‘dude, this is awesome. What is this?'” he shared. “So I think that champions us as writers because it shows that just because a song doesn’t get picked up after the first pitch doesn’t mean that it’s over. I’m proud of having this one on this album.”</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-98297"><img decoding=async data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DustinLynch_BlueInTheSky_Coverfinal-1024x1024.jpg alt width=662 height=662 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Fans can hear Dustin’s new music live and in person when he takes it on the road for a massive headlining&nbsp;<strong>Party Mode Tour&nbsp;</strong>with budding country crooner&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Sean Stemaly.</a>&nbsp;</strong>The life of the party will throw down with back-to-back kickoff performances at iconic Texas venues Gruene Hall in New Braunfels on March 17 and Billy Bob’s Texas in Fort Worth on March 18, before letting loose with arena-sized crowds nationwide.
