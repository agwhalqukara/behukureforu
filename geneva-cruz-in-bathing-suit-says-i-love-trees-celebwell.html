She says that she decided to cut alcohol out. "I stopped drinking alcohol three years ago. It seems that I have already graduated there, I have already settled there. I know for a fact that alcohol can make your skin dry, and when the skin is dry, it is easier to get wrinkles."</span></p><p><span>Cruz opened up about her diet to Philstar.com. She says that while she eats healthy, she also believes in balance. "I love vegetables, I love protein. I eat rice but not so much. I eat cakes. Sometimes five cup cakes, you know that? I'm just being a woman who loves sweets. But as much as possible, every day, I watch what I eat."</span></p><p><span>Cruz is all about being happy. She shared some of her secrets for doing this to Philstar.com. "I choose to be happy," Cruz says. "I choose to look at the bright side. Every day, so I don't feel sad, I just think of the things I have now. I focus of what I have instead of things I don't have."</span></p><p><span>Cruz shares a lot of her fitness secrets </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>on Instagram</span></a><span>, including how she stays motivated. "If you struggle with motivation, the best way to get abs—female style is to find your girl support team! Get yourselves a training partner; I sometimes kulit my cousin @glenda_cbayona to train me or train with me when I'm lacking motivation. Another tip would be to save a photo on your phone of the body you want, or print and post the picture on the wall where you can always see it."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Cruz tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>GMA</span></a><span> that she's all about self-love, especially as she's gotten older. "Other than that, I love myself better at this age: I've learned to reevaluate myself and the others around me, I rarely worry about little things, most especially the things I have no control of, I stay away from toxic people, and get really happy and continue to work on being financially independent with my very first business which I am so nervous and excited about. I believe It's never too late to reinvent ourselves."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkoJ2emsOiecKrrLNlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKyYsqtdnnqtu9WeZK2qlZrAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./base-behind-which-an-umpire-calls-balls-and-strikes.html><span>←</span><span>Base behind which an umpire calls balls and strikes</span></a>
