The line-up has yet to be confirmed, but as rumours of who might enter are in full flow BoyleSports has priced up who of the rumoured celebs will win should they enter.</p><p>Marc O‘Neill may have lost out on winning Big Brother, but he could get a second, actually third, chance at winning the show and is topping the betting at 8/1 to win the Celebrity version. Also heading the betting is loveable X Factor novelty act Stevie Richie, who is also 8/1 should he enter. Reality stars Vicki Pattison and James Hill, from the Apprentice, are also contenders to win at 9/1 apiece.</p><p>Dan Osbourne and Dapper Laughs have been both been involved in their fair share of scandals and the Big Brother house could be a place for redemption, should the pair enter they are 12/1 and 16/1 to win respectively.</p><p>Hulk Hogan is expected to be the big US star of the series and is 10/1 to win. Stevie’s new fiancé Chloe Jasmine has also been rumoured to join the line-up and could last longer than her stint on the X Factor and is available at 10/1 to win.</p><p>Other US stars in the running are Caitlyn Jenner, Janice Dickinson, Teen Mom star Farrah Abrahams, who are all 25/1 and porn star Jenna Jameson who is bottom of the betting at 33/1.</p><p>Aoife Heffron, PR Executive at BoyleSports, commented “Marc O’Neill was a loss to the Big Brother house and has shot to fame since. We have seen recent reality stars jump ship to appear in another show, Jack Quickenden went on to I’m A Celeb after being booted off of the X Factor and we suspect Marc could do the same with Celebrity Big Brother. This time round however the Dub is expected to go on and win”</p><p>She added “Hulk Hogan could set the Celebrity Big Brother house alight with Hulkamania and should he enter, he is one to watch at 10/1 to win.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kr6qzjJupqKyYmr9ufo9qbGalkaewbrvNnqClpF2pvG6%2BxK2sq6Zdm7yzecKbmWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-ac-company-list-of-leading-air-conditioning-companies-in-johannesburg.html><span>←</span><span>Best AC company: List of leading air conditioning companies in Johannesburg</span></a>
