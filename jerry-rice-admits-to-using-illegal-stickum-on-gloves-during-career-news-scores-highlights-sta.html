But, as he said regarding the Patriots, he still had an edge."</span></p><p>Much in the same way Rice's acknowledgement that deflating footballs had little impact on the 2015 AFC title game, Rice's legacy isn't all of a sudden tainted by his admitted use of banned adhesive substances.</p><p>However, it sheds light on another way that players have gamed the system to their advantage. The Patriots, if found guilty, will be far from the first team to gain a possibly illegal edge on the competition, and they almost certainly won't be the last.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaWxtZm2AcXnJnqmrsV2ntqSxjJqbpqGkqHq1u4yuqqKml2K2rbjEoJilZaOptqS31KZkqKZdnLmwwsSsZJ2top67qHnCmqmenaI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeopardy-host-who-grew-up-in-the-mormon-church-2-wds.html><span>←</span><span>Jeopardy! host who grew up in the Mormon church: 2 wds.</span></a>
