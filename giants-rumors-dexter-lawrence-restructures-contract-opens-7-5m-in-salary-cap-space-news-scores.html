He had 53 total tackles, 4.5 sacks and 21 hits on the quarterback in 16 games.</p><p>The franchise had a pressing need to create some flexibility with the 2024 NFL draft a little over a month away. Before Thursday's move, it had just <a href=# rel=noopener>$2 million</a> in cap space, the lowest figure in the league.</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Jordan Raanan</a> reported offensive tackle Andrew Thomas is "likely next" in terms of contract restructures. Thomas, who's in the first year of his <a href=# rel=noopener>five-year, $117.5 million</a> deal, has a $14.2 million base salary and a total of $8 million in signing and roster bonuses for the upcoming season.</p><p>The biggest free agents have already signed, so general manager Joe Schoen probably isn't plotting a major addition between now and the draft. Beyond having enough money to sign their draft picks, amending Lawrence's and presumably Thomas' deals will give the Giants more wiggle room to tweak the roster depending on what issues and opportunities arise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWiFeX%2BMoKCapqSoerPBzKiprGWUmsW1sdFmo5qvopq7pLGMq5ysrKKqsLXB0Z6qZpufo8GzrcKtZKiolaPAboOUpmSipl2orq2t0bJknJmgYsCxrcKe</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-clooney-reveals-amal-clooney-took-28-minutes-to-answer-his-marriage-proposal.html><span>←</span><span>George Clooney Reveals Amal Clooney Took 28 Minutes to Answer His Marriage Proposal</span></a>
