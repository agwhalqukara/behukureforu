But her gripes against the music industry, and in particular their penchant for celebrating "women with very slim bodies," and rewarding those celebs with Video of the Year nominations, were taken personally by Swift.</p><p>As a slim woman with a Video of the Year nomination (for "Bad Blood"), the 25-year-old took exception to the shout-out, responding, "@NICKIMINAJ I've done nothing but love & support you. It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.."</p><p>PHOTOS: Biggest celebrity feuds</p><p>Minaj and Swift later cooled things off with some mutual love and respect, but not before some other celebs' interest had been piqued!</p><p>Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul chimed in with an offer to play peace keeper. "Dear @taylorswift13 and @NICKIMINAJ, I love you both. How about we all get together and talk this thru? Coffee? Pancakes?? My treat.

"@BrunoMars any way we do dis you gon' come up short," he replied, before Mars came back:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>That Cut deep..U always know how to sheer me to the core.

When she captioned a picture of herself on Instagram with the words “Imma let you finish but…” fans instantly thought it was a reference to husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>'s infamous meme-inspiring VMAs moment when he stormed Swift's stage in 2009.</p><p>“I'm not trying to shade anyone! That's not my style!” the pregnant reality star <a href=#>quickly tweeted</a>, distancing herself from the confusion. “I just thought that caption was perfect for that pic!
