Even if that means essentially getting married again.</p><p>Fifteen years after they tied the knot, Julia and her husband, <a href=#>Danny Moder</a>, are ready to retighten it. On Sunday, Oct. 15, the parents-of-three were at Oprah Winfrey’s Super Soul Sunday brunch at her home in Montecito, CA, where a witness overheard them talking about renewing their vows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/julia-roberts-danny-moder-0.jpg><p>Julia and Danny.</p><p>Julia, 49, and Danny, 48, were chatting with other couples and “beamed” when the subject came up, the witness told <a href=#>Life & Style</a>: “They said they still feel like newlyweds at times. Julia said she would renew her vows if they could do it at a gorgeous location like Oprah’s home.” Word got back to Oprah, but whether she hosts the event or not, “Julia is seriously thinking about it,” the witness says. “It may not happen at Oprah’s, but it will happen.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Pretty Woman star</a> has been hitched to her husband Danny since 2002. Even though they celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary earlier this year, the couple has faced many bumps in the road in the past.</p><p>Between their <a href=#>conflicting parenting styles</a>, family tragedies, and more, Julia and Danny almost didn’t make it — and it all began when they first started seeing each other in 2000 when Julia was still involved with actor Benjamin Bratt.</p><p>“His relatives used to have a lot of contempt toward Julia,” a source told Closer Weekly in a new exclusive interview, adding that “they accepted her as part of their family” once the two tied the knot in 2002. Before marrying Danny, Julia was married to Lyle Lovett from 1993 until 1995.</p><p>After overcoming that difficult milestone, the couple welcomed now-12-year-old twins, Phinnaeus and Hazel, in November 2004 and son Henry, now 10, in June 2007. “Becoming parents definitely strengthened Julia and Danny’s marriage,” the insider said. “Julia’s family is the most important thing to her. She couldn’t handle watching it fall apart, so she committed to doing whatever she had to do to keep it together.”</p><p>The <a href=#>suicide of Julia’s half-sister</a> and the death of her mother from lung cancer lead Danny and Julia to take a break in their relationship. “Julia and Danny took some time off,” the insider confessed. “And spent a lot of time working on their marriage.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/julia-roberts-family-0.jpg><p>Julia and Danny with their kids.</p><p>Since rekindling their romance, the pair has found happiness in sharing their hobbies and of course parenting their three adorable children. “I’m genuinely and deeply a happy person,” Julia has said in the past. “As life goes on, you realize what great fortune that is.”</p><h2>More From <i>Closer Weekly</i><br></h2><p><a href=#>Julia Roberts Feels More “Centered and Self-Confident” Ahead of Her 50th Birthday (EXCLUSIVE)</a></p><p><a href=#>Julia Roberts Was on ‘Law and Order’?
