You’ll show Good Morning America. We got the wife on! … We’ll show you, Robin Roberts! Matt Lauer is going to get sick next — watch!” &nbsp;Almost everyone, including Lauer, instantly became uncomfortable by Rock’s comment and it was clear that he had taken things a little too far. &nbsp;Since the incident, Internet&nbsp;users everywhere have been commenting on Rock’s poor taste in jokes. &nbsp;Watch the video below and comment your opinion on Chris Rock’s Robin Roberts cancer joke.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv4Uh9Srpqw</a></p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGilqGWfo7JuuMCunqGhnpx6pLTRoqpmqp%2BYuLR50aiZoqZdp7yjsdGtqmabkaOwpr6Mo6aknV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-bella-confirms-breakup-with-john-cena-was-about-him-not-wanting-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Nikki Bella Confirms Breakup With John Cena Was About Him Not Wanting Kids!</span></a>
