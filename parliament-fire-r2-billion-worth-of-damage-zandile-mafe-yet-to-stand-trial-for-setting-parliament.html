At the time, <a href=#>Mafe was accused </a>of gaining access to the precinct through a window and igniting the blaze.</p><p class=align-left>According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">News24</a></i>, Mafe has been in police custody <a href=#>since his arrest</a> and is being kept at Pollsmoor Prison. Mafe's trial is expected to begin on 27 January due to numerous delays caused by Mafe and his legal team.</p><p class=align-left>The accused embarked on a hunger strike in protest of his arrest and refused to appear at the Western Cape <a href=#>High Court</a> on two occasions. At one point, Mafe stated that he would not appear in court if he was not granted a kettle, coffee, flat-screen TV and a radio to listen to the news.</p><h2>Repairs to Parliament will cost R2 billion</h2><p class=align-left>Xolile George, the new secretary to Parliament announced that it would cost at least R2 billion to repair the damage caused by the Parliament blaze.</p><p class=align-left>According to <i><a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">EWN</a></i>, it would take at least three years to restore the National Assembly to its former glory.
